# General Suggestions
Know your geography in Japan. Since everything is easily accessible by high speed train, you can plan your trip by region.

## Airports
Tokyo:
1. Narita airport
This is the main international airport near Tokyo. To get to and from here, you can take the Narita express for ~30,000 yen ($30 USD).

2. Haneda airport
This is the domestic airport near Tokyo.

Osaka
1. Kansai airport
This is the main airport near Osaka. It is easy to get to and from here using the metro.

## Sights

Osaka:

Kyoto:

Nara:
