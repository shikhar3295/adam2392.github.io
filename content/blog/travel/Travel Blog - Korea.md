# General Suggestions
## Sights


## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.



## Nightlife/Drinking


## Getting Around


# FAQ
1. Q: Where should I stay? 
A: Generally, I'm an advocate of staying downtown because then everything is walking distance. If not, I would try to stay within walking distance to a subway station. Stay away from South Chicago because that is a very crime-ridden area.

2. Q: I only have a day in Seoul, where should I go?
A: Purple pig, Girl on the goat, Lou Malnati's to eat. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park and the River Walk to see. Signature Room for a night time drink if you have the time.
