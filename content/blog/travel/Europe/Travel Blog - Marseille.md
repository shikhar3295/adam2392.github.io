## Airports
#### 1. Marseille Provence Airport
This is the main airport for Marseille and it is located about 30 minutes north of the city. For transportation, you really only have two options: taxi/uber, or taking the bus. The bus is actually very convenient and runs every ~15-20 minutes and goes to Aix en Provence and also Marseille St Charles Station. 

If you are 25 y/o or younger, it only costs 6 euros, but for everyone else it is 8 euros. 

## Sights
1. Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde
A huge castle

2. Musee des Civilisations d'Europe
A really cool looking museum. This actually lights up at night and just has a really cool architecture. It is also free on the first Sunday of every month!

3. Cathedral La Major
This is just a very pretty looking cathedral that stands next to the water. It is a beautiful place to watch the sunset.

4. Vieux Port
A docking port that has a lot of tourists and boats. Nice place to walk around. Feel free to come here for trips to Les Calanques, or Chateau d'lf and Frioul Archipelago. 

5. Les Calanques
A hiking trail and place to go to check out a sick view.

6. Parc Longchamp
Cool park

7. Orange Velodrome
soccer stadium

8. Chateau d'lf
An island fortress and former prison 

9. Frioul Archipelago
An island 8 km off the coast of Marseille.


## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.
#### 1. House of Raviolis

#### 2. Le Maison Geney

#### 3. Noodles Chop

#### 4. Sur Le Pouce

#### 5. Tapas Rojas

## Nightlife/Drinking


## Getting Around
The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the train/metro. If you are here for the weekend, or more, I would suggest getting the 10 ride pass. It is perfectly affordable, but if you're running late, you can easily get a taxi.

Other then that, feel free to walk in most areas in the south part of the city, or just call an uber!

# FAQ
1. Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.
2. Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near Vieux Port, Joliette, or the southern part of the city.
