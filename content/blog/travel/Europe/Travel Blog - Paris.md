## Airports
#### 1. Charles De Gaulle Airport
The main international airport of France! If you're coming here, you can take an RER train into the city for ~10 euros, so if you have 3, or 4 people, honestly I think Ubering into the city is not a bad option.

#### 2. Orly Airport
The other airport that is on the other side of the city, on the south end. If you need to travel between airports, there is a shuttle that runs.

## Sights
#### 1. Eiffel Tower
The iconic Eiffel tower. I liked taking a walk around the entire area, and my favorite spot is definitely from the Palaid de Chaillot, and the Jardins du Trocadero. My favorite time is probably during sunset, when the Eiffel tower looks golden.

#### 2. Champs De Lysee (I think that's how it's spelled)
An iconic boulevard that leads from the Arc de Triomphe to this Ferris Wheel. It's a bunch of shops and just a very nice walkway. At night time, it looks amazing.

#### 3. Sacre-Coeur
Another big chapel in Europe! But this is nice to get a city view of the entire Paris. It's also a nice area to just bring a few baguettes and bottles of wine to come chill at the steps.

#### 4. Louvre
Famous museum. Two entrances that are either through the big iconic pyramid, or through the metro stop. Usually... the metro entrance has less of a line, but it's still pretty long (although waiting in doors is way nicer!). Would recommend getting there early, or going on an off day. 

#### 5. Les Catacombes de Paris 
TBD

#### 6. Arc de Triomphe
Iconic. Probaby not worth going up in my opinion, but you can come here and then walk down Champs De Lysee.

#### 7. Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris
Also... very famous and worth going once.

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Robert et Louis
Sick steak place. Very old and nice interior that is super French.

#### 2. La Duree
Expensive macarons that are... extremely worth it. Also great pastries!


## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Wine Drinking On the Seine/Near Eiffel Tower:
Around the Seine, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. 

## Getting Around
This city can get pretty big, but most of the famous iconic spots are north of the Seine, so you could technically walk it, but I would definitely recommend getting a packet of metro tickets (they sell up to 10 at a time).

# FAQ
1. Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.

2. Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the Seine river if possible! Preferably on the north side because it's nicer.
