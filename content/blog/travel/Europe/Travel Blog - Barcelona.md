## Airports
#### 1. Barcelona Airport (BCN)
This is a large international airport that has a metro service to the city (which I recommend you to just buy a multi-day pass, since it covers your exit from the airport). This is great because you don't have to worry about finding a bus, or taxi, or uber.

It also has buses that run towards the city, which might be faster.

## Sights
#### 1. La Sagrada Familia


#### 2. Parc Guell
Sex shows, prostitutes in windows, sex shops and a very red lit district.

#### 3. Arc de Triomf

#### 4. Bunkers Del Carmel

#### 5. Mount Tibidabo


## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Tapas 
Indonesian food is big in the Netherlands because they used to be a trading country. A lot of places can be overpriced though (even if they are good), but I found this place to be fairly priced and actually very great!

#### 2. Seafood Market (La Paradeta)


## Nightlife/Drinking
https://xceed.me/blog/en/best-night-clubs-in-barcelona/

#### 1. Opium Nightclub

#### 2. Pacha Nightclub


#### 3. Shoko Nightclub

#### 4. Gothic Quarter

## Getting Around
You can definitely use the metro system in Barcelona! I recommend buying the multi-day passes.
