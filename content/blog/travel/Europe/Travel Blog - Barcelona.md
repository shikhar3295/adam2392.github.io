## Airports
#### 1. Barcelona Airport (BCN)
This is a large international airport that has a metro service to the city (which I recommend you to just buy a multi-day pass, since it covers your exit from the airport). This is great because you don't have to worry about finding a bus, or taxi, or uber.

It also has buses that run towards the city, which might be faster.

## Sights
#### 1. La Sagrada Familia
This should be considered an eighth wonder of the world. It is definitely one of the most popular attractions and is well worth the ticket. It is an architectural phenomenon designed by Gaudi, the famous architect. It's been under construction for a long time....

#### 2. Parc Guell
This is a famous nice park. You need to book tickets ahead of time to get into the most iconic area, but the rest of the park is open all day. The actual inside of the park is open at 6AM and free until 8AM, but then tickets run all day. There is a limited supply, so you definitely need to buy these ahead of time.

#### 3. Arc de Triomf
Just the famouse Spanish Arc. It's a nice park and walkway area to hang out and have a picnic.

#### 4. Bunkers Del Carmel
TBD

#### 5. Mount Tibidabo
If you've ever watched friends, this is the setting of one of Joey's infamous pick up lines. But for real, it's actually a really nice mountain to hike up to and their is an observatory and an amusement park at the top! Check online for the trolley schedule that brings you up the mountain, else you will have to definitely hike it.

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Tapas 
Indonesian food is big in the Netherlands because they used to be a trading country. A lot of places can be overpriced though (even if they are good), but I found this place to be fairly priced and actually very great!

#### 2. Seafood Market (La Paradeta)
Fresh seafood that is bought by the gram. They cook it in simple options (e.g. with tomato sauce, or just steamed, or raw) and then call your number. It is legit.

## Nightlife/Drinking
https://xceed.me/blog/en/best-night-clubs-in-barcelona/

#### 1. Opium Nightclub
More edm/top 40.

#### 2. Pacha Nightclub
Your spanish / latin music night club.

#### 3. Shoko Nightclub
Spanish / edm / top 40.

#### 4. Gothic Quarter
Just this nice area to walk in with a bunch of shops, bars, restaurants scattered throughout. It is an extremely old area and feels like you're walking almost in historical times.

## Getting Around
You can definitely use the metro system in Barcelona! I recommend buying the multi-day passes.
