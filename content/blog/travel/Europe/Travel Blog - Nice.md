## Airports
#### 1. Nice Airport
TBD

## Hostel
#### 1. Hostel Antares
This was one of the few times I've stayed in a hostel and it completely changed my mind on hostels! It was pretty clean and had AC in doors.

There is also free wine at 7PM each day and there is an outdoor area that connects with another hostel, where you can go and cook food, hang out and meet other people. It was about 100 meters from the main train station and a short walk to the beach area. Overall, great atmosphere, living conditions and location.

## Sights
#### 1. Castle Hill
This is just a sick overlook of the entire city. I spent a day just exploring this area and enjoying the views while eating a baguette.

#### 2. Monaco
The infamouse Monaco is only a 30-40 minute train ride away and costs 6 euros round trip (if you're under 25), but really cheap no matter what! Monaco has a lot of great sights and is pretty easy to explore by foot, or by bus once you get there. 

Beware that everything in Monaco is EXTREMELY expensive, so if you want to save money, go eat on the outskirts, on the French border side, or pack some food. 

Monaco is very small, and is separate from France, so you can easily walk between the two "countries" after getting off the train station.

#### 3. Promenade Des Anglais
This is the walkway along the beaches of Nice. It is absolutely amazing to come both during the day and the night. The waters are light blue and the beach is made of pebbles. There are plenty of activities going on that you can pay for.

I came here and drank some wine, while just people watching for a few hours.

#### 4. Cannes
This is also a 30-40 minute train ride away, but I heard that besides the Sundance festival, or if you're a family/couple, it's nothing special.

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Chez Moi
This is a smalltime french restaurant that shouldn't break the bank. Great duck! Escargot was average, but at least affordable.

#### 2. Illia Pasta
Cheap pasta found in one of the alleys of the old-town of Nice. It is pretty fresh and affordable (~10 euros), so enjoyed it a lot!

#### 3. Chez Pipo
The infamous Soca is from this area apparently. It's just basically... French pancakes, but it was really good here (and cheap)! Have it with some rose.

#### 4. Cafe de Turin
This is a seafood bar/cafe that surrounds a big square with Museums (i.e. contemporary and modern art) around the corner. It was nice to come here and grab 6 oysters, which were HUGE and pretty good. It's not extremely cheap or anything, but it's worth to come here and get some seafood to stay healthy.

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Wine Drinking On Promenade Des Anglais:
Around the entire promenade, you can drink and just relax, French-style.

#### 2. Wayne Bar
This is a pretty popping bar area that has a lot of people from all over the world. Nice place with live music.

## Getting Around
You can pretty much walk this entire city.

# FAQ
1. Q: How do I get around?
