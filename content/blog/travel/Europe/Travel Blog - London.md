## Airports
#### 1. London Airport (Stansted)
This airport is on the north end of the city and you can take a train to get into the city, which will take about 40 minutes. However, there are always long security lines and a long passport control line. I suggest hustling out of your planes and also budgeting for travel time.

The total time would probably be 1.5 hours to/from the city center of London.

#### 2. London Airport (Heathrow)
TBD

#### 3. London Airport (Gatwick)
This airport is huge! Also has huge lines for security, so I would come early by at least 2 hours even if you're not checking in luggage. It takes awhile to get to some of the farther off gates. If you come early, they have some great airport lounges though!

#### Notes:
UK has some weirdly strict rules on liquids that you can carry out from their airports. Like all EU countries, they require you to put liquids into a small plastic zip up, but they won't even let you bring in contact solution (in the big containers)! Most EU country airports will let you bring this on since it is a medical necessity. 

## Sights
<!-- 1. Stonehenge day trip / Salisbury 
Southwest train from waterloo for 1.5 hrs
3. Oxford:
Oxford Univ.
Ashmolean Museum
Pitt Rivers Museum -->

#### 1. London Eye
Recommended to go and check out, but totally not worth going up. Beware of pick-pockets around this extremely crowded tourist area.

#### 2. Buckingham Palace / Big Ben
Self-explanatory place.

#### 3. Millenium Bridge / Tower Bridge
Great looking bridge that you can go up with ~10 pounds. Also recommended at night because it lights up!

#### 4. Cambridge
You get there via Greater Anglia train for 1.5 hrs. Once there, you can go see:
- King's college chapel
- Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial
- Univ. of Cambridge (imo the coolest part because it is such a historical university)
- The River Cam

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp. London has a ridiculous amount of people, so if you have 3+ people, I would highly recommend trying to make reservations in advance.

#### 1. Lanzhou LaMian Noodle:
Amazing handpulled noodle restaurant for any asian food cravings.

#### 2. Burger and Lobster:
Amazing burger and lobster. Simplistic and reasonably priced.

#### 3. Chick N Sours:
Great fried chicken place that is actually really healthy formulas for the fact that it is fried chicken!

#### 4. 

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Mr. Fogg's Residence
Great speak-easy looking place! Serves some interesting drinks, but can get quite pricey.

#### 2. Ministry of Sound


## Getting Around
You can definitely use the Underground, or just walk! UberX/Pool/Plus if necessary.
