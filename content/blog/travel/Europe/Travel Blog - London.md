## Airports
#### 1. London Airport (Stansted)
This airport is on the north end of the city and you can take a train to get into the city, which will take about 40 minutes.

#### 2. London Airport (Heathrow)
TBD

#### 3. London Airport (Gatwick)
This airport is huge! Also has huge lines for security, so I would come early by at least 2 hours even if you're not checking in luggage. It takes awhile to get to some of the farther off gates. If you come early, they have some great airport lounges though!
