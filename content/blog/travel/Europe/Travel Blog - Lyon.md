## Airports
#### 1. Lyon Airport
TBD

## Sights
#### 1. Basilisque Notre Dame Foire:
Essentially another basilisque that is very beautiful and overlooks Lyon. It has an amazing view of the city. If you want nice lighting, I suggest coming in the middle to late afternoon. 

It is located on Fourviere Hill. Note that Google maps shows a circular route to take up the hill, but there is a staircase at the bottom that goes straight up. You just have to find it :).

#### 2. Vieux Lyon:
The historic area of the city that is pretty cool.

#### 3. Le Mur Des Canuts:
This is a huge mural on the side of a building in the northern part of Lyon. It is incredibly picturesque and it's very fun to just try different poses to fit into the mural!

#### 4. Musée Des Beaux-arts de Lyon:
This is the largest fine art museum after the Louvre in Paris. It is only 4 euros for a student, so it is highly recommended to go and check out some great art! There are some Monet pieces in here that are absolutely amazing.

#### 5. Parc de La Tete d’Or: 
This is a super cool looking park, known as the Golden Park.

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Slake:
This is a fantastic coffee cafe that serves some great breakfast foods, like quiche, sandwiches and cookies. Highly recommend as a start off to your day.

#### 2. Yaafa:
This is essentially a vegetarian falafel shop that is extremely affordable and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend coming here if you're just sick and tired of French food.

#### 3. Bollywood Tandoor:
This is an authentic Indian restaurant that also serves a buffet style portion. It's not bad and pretty affordable too!

#### 4. Lyonnaise Cuisine:
If you're going to be in Lyon, then you absolutely have to try Lyonnaise cuisine once. Go on Tripadvisor and make a reservation for a heavily reviewed restaurant. 

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Wine Drinking On the Rhone:
Around the Rhone, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. 

## Getting Around
You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, Uber is plentiful!

# FAQ
1. Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.

2. Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the rivers Rhone and Saone towards the center of the city, else you'll spend an incredible amount of time walking/ubering.
