## Airports
#### 1. Dublin Airport 
Big international airport that you can get RT bus tickets to the city for 12 euros. It takes about 30-40 minutes and runs pretty frequently.

Note that I only spent 2 days here, and I think it's not worth anymore then that, unless you are planning daytrips from Dublin!

## Sights
#### 1. Guiness St. James Gate Brewery
Self-explanatory and a must-see. There's a sick panoramic view at the top with a free beer waiting for you with the purchase of the tour ticket.

#### 2. Jameson Distillery
Also self-explanatory. You get to do a tasting of different types of whiskey, bourbon and scotch! 

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or tripadvisor.

#### 1. Klaw
Sick seafood restaurant. Very small, so don't be surprised if you have to wait! I got the lobster roll and pasta with mussels. Fantastic.

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Temple Bar
There is live music every night and this area (i.e. Temple Street) is always lively and busy. Pop into different bars and get some Guiness!

## Getting Around
You can definitely use the tram/bus system here! The overall city isn't that big, so you can honestly just walk everywhere.
