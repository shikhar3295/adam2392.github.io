## Airports
#### 1. Dublin Airport 


## Sights
#### 1. Guiness St. James Gate Brewery

#### 2. The Book of Kells
Sex shows, prostitutes in windows, sex shops and a very red lit district.

#### 3. Jameson Distillery


## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

#### 1. Tang Cafe

#### 2. 

#### 3.

## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Temple Bar
There is live music every night and this area (i.e. Temple Street) is always lively and busy.

#### 2. 

## Getting Around
You can definitely use the tram/bus system in Amsterdam! I recommend buying the multi-day passes. 

Another option is completely walking the city (uhh), or renting a bike and getting around like the locals do.
