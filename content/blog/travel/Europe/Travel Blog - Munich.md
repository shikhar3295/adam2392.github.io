## Airports
1. Munich International Airport
Getting to the city from the airport is extremely easy. Just check google maps and you can take a direct S (1, or 8) train into the city. You can easily buy a ticket before reaching the station (within the airport) because it will definitely be crowded if it's tourist season.

## Sights
### 0. Dachau Concentration Camp (!)
One of the most important places to visit in Munich I think. You can google map and just take a short train ride over to this area. Then there is an easy to use bus, which you will need to use coins to buy a ticket.

### 1. Museum Brandhorst
TBD

### 2. St Peter's Church Tower / Marianplatz
This is the central location in old town and is a lively place with lots of small shops. It features a really old and pretty looking church. It is a short walk to Hofbrauhaus and Viktualienmarkt where you can get a lot of good street food.

### 3. Eisbachwelle
This is a local gem. This area is where surfers come for a man-made river that is just off the side of the road under a bridge. You can come here and spend some time looking at surfers go on some crazy waves.

### 4. Hofgarten
Pretty garden area close to the local government building.

### 5. Friedensengel (Angel of Peace)
Historic monument dedicated to peace. Made out of gold.

### 6. English Garden (Monopterus)
TBD (closed during winter)

### 7. BMW Museum
BMW is headquartered in Munich and this museum features all the history and culture behind BMW. Very cool place to check out and also next door features all their luxury and next-generation cars on sale.

### 8. Nymphenburg Palace
An old palace that is worth walking around and checking out. The local huge pond features a bunch of swans always swimming around.

### 10. Flaucher
TBD

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

### 1. Pasta e Basta
Great pasta for a simple price

### 2. Steinhall 16
Great place for wiener-schnitzel and also currywurst!

### 3. Viktualienmarkt
Great area for street food and local shopping for spices if you want.

### 4. Haufbrohaus
A touristic beer hall that features 1 Liter beers and some traditional bavarian style food. It's a great place to go listen to live music, meet new people and get really really drunk. The beer is actually quite tasty!

### 5. Burrito Company
If you're craving Mexican food while in Europe, this is the place to go. With a student ID, you can get a really authentic cheap burrito meal.

### 6. Augustiner Braustuben
This is a less touristic beer hall, that features the local Augustiner beer. In my opinion it is a great beer and probably the best in Munich. Less crowded and boisterous then Haufbrohaus.

## Nightlife/Drinking
### 1. Oktoberfest

### 2. Christmas Markets
Pink Christmas Market

Christkindlmarkt

Christmas Market at the Chinese Tower

## Getting Around
The best way to get around would be the S line and the U, which goes throughout the entire city. It is pay by an honor system.

Other then that, you can take an Uber or a taxi.
