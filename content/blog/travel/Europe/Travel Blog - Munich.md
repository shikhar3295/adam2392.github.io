## Airports
1. Munich International Airport
Getting to the city from the airport is extremely easy. Just check google maps and you can take a direct S (1, or 8) train into the city. You can easily buy a ticket before reaching the station (within the airport) because it will definitely be crowded if it's tourist season.

## Sights
### 0. Dachau Concentration Camp (!)
One of the most important places to visit in Munich I think. You can google map and just take a short train ride over to this area. Then there is an easy to use bus, which you will need to use coins to buy a ticket.

### 1. Museum Brandhorst

### 2. St Peter's Church Tower / Marianplatz

### 3. Eisbachwelle

### 6. Friedensengel (Angel of Peace)


### 7. English Garden (Monopterus)

### 8. BMW Museum

### 9. Nymphenburg Palace

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

### 1. Pasta e Basta
Great pasta for a simple price

### 2. Steinhall 16

### 3. Viktualienmarkt

### 4. Haufbrohaus

### 5. Burrito Company

## Nightlife/Drinking

### 3. Christmas Markets
Pink Christmas Market

Christkindlmarkt

Christmas Market at the Chinese Tower

## Getting Around
The best way to get around would be the S line and the U, which goes throughout the entire city. It is pay by an honor system.

Other then that, you can take an Uber or a taxi.
