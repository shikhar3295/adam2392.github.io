## Airports
1. Munich International Airport
Getting to the city from the airport is extremely easy. Just check google maps and you can take a direct S train into the city. You can easily buy a ticket before reaching the station (within the airport) because it will definitely be crowded if it's tourist season.

## Sights
### 1. Museum Brandhorst

### 2. St Peter's Church Tower

### 3. BMW Museum

### 4. English Garden (Monopterus)

### 5. Dachau Concentration Camp

### 6. Friedensengel (Angel of Peace)

Marianplatz
Hofgarten
Flaucher
Eisbachwelle
9. Nymphenburg Palace

## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.

### 1. Pasta e Basta
Great pasta for a simple price

### 2. Steinhall 16


### 3. Viktualienmarkt

### 4. Haufbrohaus

## Nightlife/Drinking
### 1. Oktoberfest

## Getting Around
The best way to get around would be the S line and the U, which goes throughout the entire city. It is pay by an honor system.

Other then that, you can take an Uber or a taxi.
