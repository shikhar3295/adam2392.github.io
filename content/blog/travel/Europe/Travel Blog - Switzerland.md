## Sights
### 1. Lucerne (Luzern)
Lucerne is a great small town that can be a base for you to visit Mount Pilatus, and Mount Rigi. It is very nice and has a nice looking bridge called "Chapel Bridge" and a cool monument called the Injured Lion Statue.

### 2. Mount Pilatus
Making this climb to the top by cable car is really worth it. It will cost you about ~50 CF total round trip, but at the top there is a hotel for skiiers in the winter and also has a beautiful view of Lucerne and the surrounding area from the top. 

There is a cool walking area that can take you inside the mountain peak for different vantage points.

### 3. Zurich
i. Rhine Falls (Neuhausen)
Amazing waterfall area that is only a 30 minute train ride away.

ii. Uetilburg
A very nice mountain hiking area that is only a 20 minute train ride out of the city. It features a nice overlook of Zurich and the surrounding areas. 

iii. Fifa Museum
This shows all the history behind the FIFA organization. Very cool place to check out for any soccer fans!

### 4. Geneva
i. CERN
This is where the infamous Hadron Collider is! This is where the Higgs Boson was discovered, and where there is very important physics research going on everyday.


## Food
Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp. Just FYI, food in Switzerland is crazy expensive! They have such a high standard of living, I went out to eat a basic Chinese meal and it cost me $40...

### 

## Nightlife/Drinking
### 1. Volkshaus
Nice night club with 3 different rooms for 3 differnet music types. Needs cash only.

### 2. Langstrasse Street
This is a street within Zurich that features many bars and clubs for all backgrounds.

## Getting Around
The best way to get around would be the SBB trains and possibly uber. The trains go over the entire country, so this is extremely worth it!

# FAQ
1. Q: Should I get a Swiss Travel Pass?
This depends on where you are staying and how long you are staying in Switzerland! The minimum multi-day pass is 3 days, so this is definitely worth it if you say plan on going to 3 different mountains because it covers your fee for all the trains and also the cable cars up, which can get pretty expensive!
