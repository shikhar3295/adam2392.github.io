## Airports
#### 1. Prague International Airport | Vaclave Havel Airport
It is highly recommended to get a taxi that for certain takes credit card. Most taxis will try to scam you and say their credit card machine stopped working. Ask before getting in!

## Getting Around
#### 1. Buses/Metro
There are essentially 30 min, 90 min and full day passes that can be bought anywhere from 1-4 euros, which is incredibly affordable for a weekend in Prague!

There are a lot of hidden pieces of art within the metro. You also get access to trams, which are great to go around the city center. The metro/tram and most buses only run until midnight.
