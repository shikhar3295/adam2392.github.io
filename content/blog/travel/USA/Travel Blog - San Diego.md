## Nightlife/Drinking
#### 1. Gaslamp District
Also a range of bars to choose from! There are rooftop bars, to basement bars to tequila bars. 

Analog is usually a very ratchet party bar/club to finish off the night.

#### 2. NorthPark
Many bars, so you can easily bar hop! There is also a coinbar in the area and a bunch of speakeasy type bars.


## Getting Around
Uber/Lyft are probably your best option if you don't have a car. Public transportation isn't really a thing in California.

# FAQ
1. Q: Where should I stay? 
A: I would try to stay at Inner Harbor, Fed Hill, or Canton.
