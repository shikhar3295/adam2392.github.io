## Old 2017 Resolutions:
#### 1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]
- This is actually something I thought would impact me a lot. I still watch hella dance vids online and keep up with hip hop news here and there, but I haven't touched the dance floor in a few months and it almost feels normal now. I get my daily excercise and I'm driven by my research and learning opportunities.

#### 2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]
- Yeah I don't know if this will ever happen... So maybe I'll aim to do a 5k next year.

#### 3. Read four new books: [x]
- Always learn from others.

#### 4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [x]
- I got to be able to deadlift 245, and bench 205 this year. I've also started working out in the morning, or at least daily. 

#### 5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [x]
- I moved to France and have been traveling my ass off. I don't intend on stopping and I've found that I started to become more comfortable with just being by myself. You really learn a lot when you have to handle everything from beginning to end without a friend/family member watching your back.

#### 6. Begin to learn French: [x]
- Used Duolingo and got to 2% fluency. Hell yeah. Well... I'm in France, so I started now LOL.

#### 7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [x]
- I was so set on the idea of data science last year, but it's all related to my interest in medicine, tech, and AI. I've been reading more papers here and there about random things ranging from deep neural networks, matrix perturbation theory, to deep reinforcement learning. None directly relate to my rsearch, but it's fascinating and great to think about how it can continue to impact my research and future growth as a data scientist / engineer.

#### 8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year [ ]
- Yeah I don't know why I thought this was feasible during a PhD. However, I've built a Node.js/React/D3.js web app at Lauz Hack this year! This is actually an exciting part of my year because it will help my research propel forward and also serve as a cool engineering project to maintain.

## 2018 Resolutions:
#### 1. Travel

#### 2. Academic

#### 3. Professional

#### 4. Personal
