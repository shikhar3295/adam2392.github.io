i picked her up on Sat morning and we just went back to my apt and hung out and talked, then played board games w/ my housemates and ate lunch at one of the spots she really likes in baltimore. Then we drove to DC and I took her to this like #3 on yelp restaurant to eat dinner. super fun and chill and like everything felt hella just like right (at least imo). She was super cute and told the waiter it was my bday so that they lit that dessert up lmfao.

so then we went to echo stage to see the show. We decided to roll instead of drinking and i think we just had a super good time dancing w/ each other and enjoying the show. We were definitely super like intimate and shit, and I don’t think it was one sided imo. She wanted to take a bunch of photos w/ me and stuff. Like Idk how to describe it, but I guess when you’re vibing w/ someone, it just feels hella good. So I drove us back to my apt and we just laid in bed watching youtube vids. I was gonna go upstairs to sleep, but she was like you can sleep here. So we just cuddled and I hugged her to sleep. (okay cathy thinks at some point in this night, I should’ve made a move, but I was nervous and didn’t wanna ruin things cuz everything was super chill so far!)

So anyways the next day, we just chilling. We are watching netflix on my couch and she’s leaning on me so I like guess put my arms around her or w/e. 

so something weird happened. we go to a crab place for lunch w/ Sean and when I go to the bathroom, she gets a text and she tells sean: oh one of my ex keeps messaging me cuz he asked me the other weekend to get back together. I told him I’m just not looking to date anyone rn. I’m really bad at saying no, but I think he probably wants to talk now cuz I kept posting photos on ig/snapchat w/ adam and it probably looks hella couply. 

So Sean instantly told me when I came back LOL, but i took that as oh dam… i guess it makes sense if she doesn’t wanna date anyone in general rn. but it was confusing to me cuz of how she acted around me the whole weekend. I drop her off at the airport  say bye. 

I talk to a bunch of ppl to recap and then Cathy convinced me that I should just call her to ask her out / tell her how i feel cuz its like prolly super obvious.

LOL so yeah that’s what I did. Called her I told her how I felt and that I would understand if she wasn’t over her ex yet. Then she told me she’s obviously into me too but she just doesn’t wanna do long distance again. / she brought up the fact that there might be a lot of expectations for us as friends to make it mean something. But she also said if I actually lived in Boston and said I wanted to take her out next week, then she would be open to it. So I think it’s mainly the distance, which is super fair. So I tried convincing her to just keep an open mind and let me take her on a date next time we’re together. And we would be super chill and it doesn’t have to be anything serious / have expectations cuz we’re both mature. It seems like she’s down and she was like basically telling her ex no, but that didn’t apply to me.

Anyways, now I’m just tryna plan a way to go up to see her to take her out before Valentine’s day because won’t be able to see her for a few weekends cuz she’s going to Iceland in 2 weeks and then has a physics test after President weekend.
