# About Me

I am a third year PhD student in biomedical engineering, specializing in computational neuroscience and machine learning at Johns Hopkins University. I work with Dr. Sridevi V. Sarma in the [Neuromedical Control Systms group](http://sarmalab.icm.jhu.edu/).

My interest in technology and engineering started at UCSD, where I graduated in 2015 with a double major in Bioengineering and Mathematics. It was there under the guidance of many great faculty, such as Dr. Todd Coleman, that I became interested in applied mathematics, data analytics and machine learning in healthcare. It led me to pursue a PhD, with the ultimate goal of bringing together technology expertise with biomedical domain knowledge to solve challenging medical problems.

I'm originally from Los Angeles, CA and consider myself a true CA native even though I wasn't born there. I have a range of hobbies, including, but not limited to: running, gymming (weight lifting), reading, hacking, traveling and photography. 

As an engineer, I consider myself an expert in Matlab and Python, being able to work with Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Keras/Tensorflow, Pytorch and more. I am familiar with Bash, Javascript, HTML, CSS, C/C++, MongoDB and SQL. I have experience with Django, Pelican frameworks. I like building stuff with Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. As a data analyst, I have experience with PBS/SLURM scheduling systems and GNU parallel. 

My domain experience includes neuroscience, linear systems, data wrangling, machine learning and algorithm development. Some things I've become interested in recently (as of 2016/2017) are bayesian statistics, malware/cybersecurity, differential geometry and blockchain technologies; basically I enjoy reading laymen-term articles about these topics. 

Everything on this site reflects my personal views only. It'll generally range from research/science thoughts, to photo blogs (in progress in the backend), to travel blogs (for my own benefit of keeping track of where I went :p).
