                <p>Each year passes by faster and faster in my opinion, so I want to make the most out of 2016.Â As 2016 comes and 2015 comes to a close, I want to make some resolutions and goals for the new year.</p>
<p>Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest.
- This year I realized that even someone who you've known for years can exit your life in an instant. I want to spend more time and money on people that are there for you when you're up and down. When shit went down for me, people who I thought I could count on were nowhere to be seen. Why waste time and effort on those people?
Read more about politics and current events in our country.
- I think that coming from California is a blessing in many ways. However, I think that we take for granted all the things we have. There is a lot of different things happening around the country (e.g. politics) that I did not educate myself on. Using politico and pulse apps to keep up to date
Start choreographing again.
- Throughout undergrad, I made excuses for not trying more in dance to improve. Whether it was coursework, social life, or laziness, I didn't put in time and effort into my passion. Will try to do at least 1 piece and work on it throughout the year.
Enter in 1-2 jams.
- Been bboying for almost 8 years and it has carried me through undergrad and high school. Want to continue going for top 8 in some big jams until I can't bboy anymore.
Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them.
- My dad gave me his old Nikon D5000 and I got a GoPro at the beginning of the summer. Photography is a way for me to keep involved in the hip hop scene once I can't dance anymore. Videos and photos are also great of documenting the year!
Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM.
- There are a lot of challenges and obstacles to overcome to get to a PhD program. There are also many to overcome whilst in the program. I want to talk about various events including: preparing for grad school in undergrad, applying for grad school, applying for fellowships, picking your rotations, picking your coursework, picking your advisor, choosing a thesis committee, structuring and studying for your DBO and then research on a daily basis. My goal is to graduate from this PhD as soon as possible (ideally 4-5 years) and start working to get industry experience.
Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC
- Been saying that I wanna do this for years... time to get started.
Spend less time on myself and volunteer more.
- Spent too much time saying I wanna help out and not enough time doing. Getting involved in THREAD at Baltimore is one step and I hope to do more. The world is too big to just always be working on yourself.
Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat).
- Good for seeing friends and chatting. Good for sending some updates once in awhile and documenting photos/videos. Not good for productivity. Aim: go from online once/day to once/two days this year.
Be content with paying my dues.
- I've always been anxious to accomplish things. However, over the next 4 years, I realized it'll be grind and work. Gaining the technical skills so I can set myself up for maximizing the probability of succeeding in a technical startup. Just have to be patient and have this same dream when I'm 29.
All resolutions are goals in my opinion. The only real way to accomplish a goal that you set your mind to is work on them in minimal increments. In entrepreneurship, they call these minimal viable products (MVPs). Everyone should check back on these goals at least once/month over 2016 to see how they're doing and work on them like they're MVPs. Won't that make for an even more exciting 2017? Happy new years. It's going to be a good one.
