&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I re-read this 1999 paper on Linear Gaussian models and I am pretty amazed at how deep this paper is in unifying the different common data analysis methods and linear models under one framework. We think of principal component analysis (PCA), or Gaussian mixture models (GMM), or Kalman filter models (KF) all as disparate ways to model data, but this review is able to bring them under the umbrella of the Expectation Maximization (EM). I wanted to highlight for myself (and anyone reading) the key high level concepts and insights and also extend these to talk about control systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a very simplifying level, linear gaussian models are heavily used in all branches of engineering from control systems, to data analysis. Expectation maximization is an iterative learning algorithm for learning some optimal parameters in a probabilistic model. In this blog post, I attempt to review the main overarching concepts that I believe are important and then also provide some recent work that draws upon the theory of linear gaussian modeling. Specifically, I look at tensor modeling (i.e. a generalization of a linear time-invariant state space model), deep neural networks to provide end-to-end learning of a state space system and variations of these deep state space models. The goal of this post is to provide the reader with a broad overview of the fundamentals that drive linear modeling to the recent state-of-the-art advancements in deep learning that draw from "older" fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Most General Linear Gaussian Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the most general form of the linear latent state-space model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) + w$$
$$y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) + v$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where: $w \approx N(0,Q)$ and $v \approx N(0,R)$ are the state and output noise terms that we assume to be normally distributed (i.e. Gaussian).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dimensionality of the terms are:
* $x, w \in R^{n}$
* $y, v \in R^{p}$
* $u \in R^{k}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some jargon for folks:
* x is the state variable, generally considered "hidden", or part of the "latent space" (i.e. some subspace of your data that you don't know)
* y is the observation variable, generally considered measured, or observed (i.e. signals in your data)
* u is our control signal, that we input
* A is our state transition matrix governing how states change 
* B is our control matrix
* C is our observation matrix
* D is our feedthrough matrix
* w and v are our random variable noise terms that we may (sometimes) assume Normally distributed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the A, B, C, D matrices have their respecting dimensionality. In general, we assume y is observed and measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Expectation Maximization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general expectation maximization boils down to two distinct steps: 1) Computing the expecation under a certain generative model (i.e. computing the expected states and covariances) and 2) Maximizing the likelihood given the states (i.e. computing the optimal parameters). In the general Gaussian model, these parameters are $\theta = {A, C, B, D, Q, R}$. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kalman Filter/Smoothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general Kalman filter assumes Gaussian noise, which we have here. Filtering is the problem of predicting the state $x(t)$ given all the observations up to time t. Smoothing is the problem of predicting the state $x(t)$ given all the observations we have (i.e. over entire window of observation of length T).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Important Models And Connections With Control Theory&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Static Models (i.e. time is not a factor)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we are dealing with just data points (i.e. sets of x's, y's), so there is no notion of time dependency. This simplifies the general model, so that A = 0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;General inference on model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$P(x | y) = \frac{P(y|x)P(x)}{P(y)} = \frac{N(Cx, R) N(0, I)}{N(0, CC^T + R)}$$
$$P(x|y) = N(\beta y, I - \beta C), \ \beta=C^T(CC^T + R)^{-1}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we presume that the state space is continuous (i.e. x is a continuous variable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Sensible) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is probably one of the most common dimensionality reduction techniques, which at the end of the day (for you lin alg folks) boils down to Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Here we assume the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the observation noise R is a multiple of the identity matrix (i.e. $R=\alpha I$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that because R is not 0, then we have some noise in the state variables, so this is very similar to probabilistic PCA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When $\alpha$ goes to 0, then the noise on the states goes to 0, while Q is still finite. This means that the only noise we assume in our model comes from our observations of the data. A naive approach would simply take the observed covariance matrix of our data, apply SVD to obtain the singular vector matrices and the singular values. The columns of C then are the principle components of PCA. The values of our latent space vector x are the principle values (i.e. singular values of our covariance matrix).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis
In factor analysis, we assume the following:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that the observation covariance matrix, R, is diagonal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state noise Q is the identity matrix &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X are considered the factors, and the key assumption assuming R is diagonal means that the model wants to put all the covariance structure in our observed data (i.e. y variables) into the unique coordinates of R. Note that if R is diagonal, then the off-diagonals (i.e. the covariances) are equal to 0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Summary
In both static modeling procedures, where we assume our latent space and observations are static, we can solve them using EM by using the general inference equations described above for the static model. P(x|y) gives you the inference estimates of states (i.e. x) for a given set of parameters (in this case: C and R). Then for a given set of states (i.e. x), we can maximize wrt the log-likelihood of our model to recover new estimates of C and R. This is the EM algorithm! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite fascinating that they wrapped this under one umbrella when most people normally look at solving for example PCA using SVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discrete State&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we presume x is a discrete variable.
1. Gaussian Mixture Models
If x is a discrete probability distribution controlled by the distribution of the noise, w. The mean $\mu$ and covariance Q parametrize the distribution of x. Now x is modeled by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x = WTA(w)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where WTA is the winner take all function applied to the vector w, so x becomes a unit vector of size n. Now the interpretation of x is the mixture weights (i.e. how much each data point y belongs to each cluster). The columns of matrix C represent the cluster means. This is solved via EM also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vector Quantization (K-means) Models
When the observation noise approaches 0 (i.e. R approaches 0), then we arrive at the k-means algorithm formulation, which can be solved via EM also. So now, P(x|y) is a single point, since there is no noise in the y term, and it is all governed by the noise in the k clusters defined in the state term. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dynamical Models (i.e. time is a factor)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we now deal with the fact that time is a factor in our model. So A is no longer the 0 matrix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Continuous State - Kalman Filter Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is generated according to the general model with the noise terms all being independently and identically distributed. This is just solved via the Kalman filter and smoothing algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all parameters are known, can employ a Maximum Likelihood approach to estimate the states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the parameters are unknown, then EM can be used to iterate on the parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Discrete State - Hidden Markov Models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we consider when the states are discrete, which lead to Hidden Markov Models. The model for the states is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x(t+1) = WTA(Ax(t)+w)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, if we constrain Q to be the identity matrix, then it will have the same covariances for all Gaussians. With traditional Hidden Markov models, we usually define a state transition matrix (e.g. normalized columns), which defines how probable different state transitions are from an initial state. Solving for the most likely state sequence employs the famous Viterbi algorithm. Solving the filtering and smoothing problems, then employ EM traditionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-Gaussian Models (i.e. noise terms are no longer normally distributed)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This results in a famous class of algorithm known as Independent Component Analaysis. This is a generalization of the PCA. Here, we have a nonlinearity applied to the state model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x = g(w)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This converts a Gaussian prior (i.e. noise variable w) into a non-Gaussian prior for the state variable x. Now, x is considered our "blind sources" and y is our observed data. In classical ICA, R is assumed to be infinitesimal, and C is square and full-rank. C is considered a "mixing matrix", that is how to mix the sources to "recover" our observed data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control Theory Type Problems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In control theory and linear systems, we are generally interested in the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the general model and outputs measured y, how do we estimate a control input u(t) that controls the dynamics of the state? That is, how do we control the eigenvalues of the system? &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This results in things like state-feedback and the notion of controllability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the general model, how can we estimate the values of the states if we know the rest of the parameters (A, B, C, D)?&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This results in observers and the notion of observability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the general model, how can we estimate an optimal u(t) that follows some constraints and minimizes some cost functional on u? (e.g. constraint on the magnitude of u, or the sparseness of u, etc.)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is known as optimal control. It can be deterministic, or stochastic. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the Kalman filter/smoothing procedure is an optimal observer under Gaussian noise assumptions. The EM algorithm can be used in general in conjunction with Kalman filter/smoothing to estimate the parameters (A, B, C, D).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions for Gaussian Linear Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I attempt to summarize some of the main points in the Roweis paper that I thought were relevant to someone with knowledge in Linear Algebra, Probability &amp;amp; Statistics and Linear Dynamical Systems. The nice thing is that all these very common algorithms and methods can be framed using Expectation Maximization. This point of view links together control theory, linear dynamical systems and machine learning. It points to how general linear Gaussian models are and how general Expectation Maximization is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dynamic Version of PCA/KMeans?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens if we assume a dynamical model, but instead the output noise is zero (i.e. Q=0)? Here, our states are completely determinable if we have our C matrix. For a linear dynamical system, we can perform PCA to obtain our principle components, which can comprise of our C matrix (i.e. how to go from principle values to observed space). For Hidden Markov Models, we can instead perform vector quantization (i.e. KMeans) to obtain our columns of C. Now, we have to actually estimate the A matrix, which is a first-order Markov dynamic matrix (i.e. governing how states change from time t to t+1). Here it boils down to a simple autoregressive (AR(1)) model in continuous time, or first order Markov chain in the discrete space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Extensions of Gaussian Linear Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I talk about some extensions to Gaussian linear models and relate them to our linear models through the lens of probability and statistics; specifically: variational inference and markov chain monte carlo. These are the main techniques in the estimation of an intractable posterior distribution. Here, we'll assume you have basic Bayesian working knowledge and comfortable with the statistics involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup of the problem is similar to that of Linear Gaussian Models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\dot{x}(t) = f(x(t)) + g(u(t)) + w$$
$$y(t) = h(x(t)) + v$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where: $w \approx Q(\theta)$ and $v \approx R(\gamma)$ are the state and output noise terms that we assume to be distributed with some distribution $Q,R$ parametrized by $\theta, \gamma$. In addition, now $f, g, h$ are all potentially nonlinear functions analogs of A, B, C. If we define some priors on the distribution of noise for the latent variables, we can perform Bayesian inference given our observed signals, y. That is, we are interested in estimating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$P(x|y) \approx P(y|x) P(x)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, that in convention with literature, P(y|x) is our likelihood of the model and P(x) is our assumed prior distribution on our latent state variable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Variational inference (VI) proceeds by: * 
Fitting the parameters of a family of tractable distributions (e.g. independent Gaussians) to approximate the posterior. For more details, see my blog post on a summary of VI and MCMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markov Chain Monte Carlo proceeds by: * 
Creating a Markov chain that has convergent properties to the true posterior. Samples are drawn from the "proposal" distribution and are either kept, or rejected based on various algorithms (e.g. important sampling, Gibbs sampling, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, etc.). For more details, see my blog post on a summary of VI and MCMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Low Rank Tensors (to generalize space, time and other variable dimensions!)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Linear Gaussian state space model, in general you are assuming that x, y, u are vectors, while A, B, C are matrices of their respective dimensions. Tensors are higher order generalizations of matrices (e.g. matrices are 2D arrays, while tensors are N-D arrays). So in the context of neural recording data where you have a suite of electrode signals that vary over time, one can think of the system as a 3D tensor (channels X channels X time); this is opposed to a normal linear time-invariant system (i.e. constant A matrix), which would just be represented as a 2D tensor (channels X channels) because time is invariant. Now, just viewing this system as a 3D tensor does not really give much room for improvement because now you are just dealing with a linear time-varying system with N^2 T parameters (N=#channels, T=#time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in the TVART paper from Rajesh Rao's group, they assume that the system's state transition matrix, A, lies in a low rank tensor. Specifically, this gives the system only a few "unique" A matrices (i.e. system state transition matrices) to choose from at any particular window of data. The number of these unique A matrices is determined by the assumption of the "low-rank" of this tensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the shortcomings of this method is that there is no easy way to determine the "low-rankness" of a dataset prior to analyzing it. I imagine that the way to proceed is to use some heuristic measure, such as Bayesian Information Criterion / Aikake's Information Criterion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming you have a good choice of the rank, then you can apply some traditional regularizations, such as l1 and l2 regularizations to enforce sparsity and smoothness in the different dimensions of the A 3D tensor (i.e. either in channel space, or in time space). Then the optimal tensor is solved for via convex optimization. The paper uses a combination of conjugate gradient and proximal gradient with Nesterov acceleration for the smooth, and non-smooth objective functions respectively. A review of these optimization terms hopefully can be covered in another blog post on optimization: convex, nonlinear and constrained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Kalman Filter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the paper on the deep Kalman Filter, the authors derive a deep neural network that is a Kalman filter analog. They explicitly assume that the latent state is modeled by a Normal distribution (i.e. $x ~ N(\mu, \Sigma)$) with possible nonlinear interactions between time steps, and that the observations are distributed according to some family of distributions (e.g. Bernoulli if observations are binary).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural network architectures that seem to work are the: i) q-RNN (filtering) and ii) q-BRNN (smoothing), which are just recurrent and bi-directional recurrent neural network architectures. They perform variational learning of the latent state parameters by maximizing a derived evidence lower bound (ELBO). In the Variational AutoEncoder paper, they talk about how to perform stochastic gradient descent by performing the re-parameterization trick on the Normal distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They introduce the notion of performing counterfactual inference by introducing an extra variable that the network conditions on. For example, you can include a vectorized variable that determines whether or not you took a drug at time t, or whether or not a specific action was taken. Then during testing, you can modify the conditional variable action and perform forward prediction to determine the x(t+1), ..., x(t+T) steps which predicts what "would have" happened if you took a certain action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Caveats of the DKF&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In experiments, they show that the DKF does not extract information about time-derivatives very well, which in general lead to problems with forward prediction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Extend To Control (EC2)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, they combine optimal control theory and deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Variational Bayes Filter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, they argue that a suite of previous methods that use a VAE-style for time series is optimized for reconstruction mainly (i.e. not prediction). This will just compress the data in the best possible manner, while allowing the data to still be reconstructed. However, there is no explicit optimization for prediction. In addition, previous methods may not explicitly include the necessary mini-batch data for the model to infer time-derivatives, thus weakening prediction as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we want to reparametrize the transition model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x(t+1) = f(x(t), u(t), \beta(t))$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Koopman Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quick Koopman Theory Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the reader (and myself), I assume we have no idea what the Koopman operator is. So first, I will overview some of the basic concepts here, so that I can introduce the Deep Koopman model. See https://www.mit.edu/~arbabi/research/KoopmanIntro.pdf for a great in-depth overview. One should be relatively comfortable with the theory of linear dynamical systems and matrix analysis (specifically the idea of state transition matrices, linearity and eigenvalues/eigenvectors). Recall a linear dynamical system without input:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where A is our linear operator of the form $T: \mathbf{R}^n -&amp;gt; \mathbf{R}^n$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the Koopman operator is that any data we collect in a real-world scenario are "observables" of our system that are a function of the underlying state (g). So the Koopman operator is a linear transformation (U) that acts on the state transition operator (A). An eigenvalue decomposition of the Koopman operator yields (possibly infinite-dimensional) eigenfunctions that span the observable space, so now all observables of a dynamical system are linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. This is quite fascinating because the idea is that you can break down nonlinear system phenomena in terms of linear Koopman eigenfunctions (nonlinear approximation by linear functions)! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$Ug(x) = g o T(x)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we can look at:
1. Limit Cycles:
This is a nonlinear system property because no linear dynamical system (i.e. x(t+1) = Ax(t)) can generate limit cycles. A limit cycle is parametrized by a period, T. So one can perform Fourier decomposition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$g(x(t)) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_j e^{ikt2\pi / T}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $a_j$ are Fourier coefficients and the exponential term can be constructed as the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator with eigenvalues $\lambda_k = ik2\pi / T$ (interestingly when eigenvalues are of this form, you have degenerate discrete time-sampling in the sense that you can lose controllability, or observability of dynamical system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hyperbolic Fixed Points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basins of Attraction (stable limit cycles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in general, you can perform Koopman mode decomposition on a vector of observables (no one just observes one data point). You get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$U^t g(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} g_k e^{\lambda_k t} \phi_k(x)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where U is our Koopman operator, g is our observable function of our state, x is our state vector, $g_k$ are the Koopman modes of the observable g at the eigenvalue $\lambda_k$, $\phi_k$ are the eigenfunctions at their respective eigenvalue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now the Deep Koopman Model&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, they parametrize the observable function using a deep neural network, and then explicitly model the decoding as a Koopman operator to learn the mappings of a latent state back into the observable data. In addition, they add special training scheme of penalizing the loss over consecutive predictive steps, so that the model learns a stable mapping that attempts to keep low error rates over many consecutive predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep Kalman Variational Autoencoders (DKVAE)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the authors formulate yet another variation of the VAE framework that is somewhat similar to the DVBF model, but with a few differences and improvements. Recall that the model for the DVBF was for locally linear transitions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x(t+1) = A(t)x(t) + B(t)u(t) + C(t)w(t)$$
$$y(t) = H(t)x(t) + y(t)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the variational parameters that parametrize the variational family is $v(t) = {A(t)^{i}, B(t)^{i}, C(t)^{i}}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the DKVAE, the model adds an additional pseudo-latent state, which is of low-dimension between the high dimensional observation space and the linear state space model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possibilities for Improved Deep State Space Models (DSSM)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that a reoccuring theme right now in deep learning is the integration of older techniques (i.e. Linear State Space Models LSSM) with deep neural networks. Since deep neural networks can act as universal function approximators, that are also able to be trained end-to-end using stochastic gradient descent on data, then many challenges in traditional LSSM that had intractable setups can potentially be overcome. Granted, you will need enough data for each situation you are thinking of, but in theory one can really extend the power of DSSM to provide improved interpretability of a deep learning model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I re-read my notes on convex optimization, nonlinear unconstrained optimization and nonlinear constrained optimization. It's quite fascinating how mathematics can break down very general assumptions into different classes of algorithms with certain convergence, convergence rate and computational cost guarantees. In general all these algorithms are iterative algorithms, that solve a certain optimization problem by taking iterations from a starting vector $x_0$. Obviously, there are other classes of algorithms that can say be solved analytically (i.e. one shot), but we're interested in how to take iterations that converge, converge fast and are computationally efficient. The different classes of algorithms can at a high level be broken down into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;convex vs nonconvex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;constrained vs unconstrained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;linear vs nonlinear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;differentiable vs non-differentiable (or smooth vs nonsmooth)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these classes of algorithms there are relatively important concepts that are present in all of them such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;regularization (i.e. the addition of a l1, l2, or p-norm operator on some variable of interest) to prevent overfitting, include prior knowledge into the model, and improve tractability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;duality (i.e. the idea of solving a related "dual" problem that has nice properties)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initialization (i.e. $x_0$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;step length (i.e. $\alpha_t$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;direction of algorithm iteration (i.e. $g_t$)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, one is interested in necessary and/or sufficient conditions for optimality and the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;does an algorithm converge and what are the necessary assumptions to do so?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the convergence rate of an algorithm (i.e. how many iterations to reach a bound on the error rate)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what is the computational cost per iteration of the algorithm (i.e. how many function evaluations, jacobian evaluations, or hessian evaluations does one need)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I will not overview is combinatorial and stochastic optimization. I will plan on adding the general concepts once I've reviewed linear, quadratic, and semidefinite programming, as well as stochastic gradient descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Methods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I preface the landscape of optimization algorithms with the general objective function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$minimize_{x \in X} f(x) \ s.t. \ g(x)=0,\ h(x) \le 0$$
$$X \subset \mathbf{R}^n$$
$$f: X -&amp;gt; \mathbf{R}$$
$$g: X -&amp;gt; \mathbf{R}^k$$
$$h: X -&amp;gt; \mathbf{R}^l$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are k equality constraints, and l inequality constraints. X is our feasible set, f is our evaluation function (think loss/cost function), g is our equality constraint function, and h is our inequality constraint function. x is our variable of interest that we want in the end that satisfies this minimization problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very general iteration looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x_{k+1} = x_k - \alpha_k g_k (x_k)$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where $\alpha$ is the step size, g is the step direction. Note that $\alpha$ can either be a vector, or scalar (depending on if you want to step uniformly, or with varying magnitudes in the direction vector) and g is a in general a vector that denotes the directionality in the space of x (i.e. $R^n$).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we make the assumption that f is convex, and in general the constraint functions are convex. Assuming convexity provides a couple of strong guarantees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the minimum we find is a global minimum, so we don't have to say rerun the algorithm with multiple initializations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;in general strong duality applies, so there is a zero duality gap (I think)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a whole theory of convex analysis and convex optimization, but here we review the main algorithms that come out of this convex assumption. In general, the algorithms can be broken down into non-smooth vs smooth (where f is either differentiable, or not). If f is not differentiable, a technical detail is that we still assume f is Lipschitz-continuous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Non-smooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we are dealing with convex functions that are not differentiable. We are able to circumvent the issue with the use of subgradients and proximal operators. This leads to algorithms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subgradient Descent Algorithm
This is essentially gradient descent, but using the subgradient. It's a basic algorithm that has guaranteed convergence with some assumptions on the choices of your step sizes, $\alpha_k$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proximal Gradient Descent Algorithm
This defines a proximal operator that IS differentiable, so that we can take gradients of the proximal operator to define our direction, and then take corresponding steps. This leads to algorithms like the iterative shrinkage threshold operator (ISTA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acceleration (Nesterov)&lt;/em&gt;
Armed with the proximal gradient, one can apply acceleration techniques of the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, which leads to algorithms like FISTA (fast ISTA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Smooth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we are dealing with convex functions that ARE differentiable (i.e you can take the derivative). Taking the derivative gives you powerful first-order information. This leads to algorithms like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gradient Descent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjugate Gradient Descent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unconstrained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we comment on the idea of unconstrained optimization. That is the objective function does not have g, or h terms (equality, or inequality constraints). In general, this leads to two classes of algorithms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;line-search methods (e.g. Armijo line-search and Wolfe conditional line search)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trust-region methods&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For convex and linear optimization problems, generally you don't need such methods, so we restrict overview until we reach the section on Nonlinear optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Constrained&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we allow for constraints either in the form of equality, and/or inequality constraints. The idea of adding constraints is really fascinating because in most (almost all) real world problems, you can formulate a loss function to optimize (based on some metric) that generally has constraints built in! This is due to the nature of the problem. For example, if you want to optimize usage of fuel in a car, you are constrained by the amount of fuel you can even have and the fact that fuel can never be negative! In general, adding constraints helps the optimization problem achieve better solutions. In order to analyze a constrained optimization problem, the strategy is to perform a "conversion" into an unconstrained problem. This leads to the definition of a Lagrangian function (draws upon physics):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$L(x,y,\lambda,\mu) = $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wealth of theory behind constraint optimization with some of the basics drawing from the idea of Lagrange multipliers (that handle equality constraints). One can generalize this notion (it's quite beautiful actually) to inequality constraints, which then handle all possible constraints you might have. This generalization leads to the notion of the Karusch-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality. The KKT conditions are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;stationarity:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;primal feasibility:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dual feasibility:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;complementary slackness: &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, these define necessary conditions for optimality, and in some special cases, they can define also sufficient conditions. Basically, with KKT conditions, you can convert any constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained version with the Lagrangian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't actually talk about the algorithms here because they get quite complex, but I will cover them in the "Programming (Linear, Quadratic and Semidefinite)" section in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nonlinear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, we now deal with the possibility of nonlinear functions f, and possibly nonlinear constraint functions. This then leads to the problem that in general, we can not find a global minima of the optimization problem. We simply find local minimums that may, or may not be a useful solution and possibly rerun the algorithms with multiple intializations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unconstrained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Line-Search Methods
The purpose of line search methods is to define a direction of search first and then perform a line search to determine a good step size. The procedure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;solve for a descent direction $B_k$. In general, it is difficult to get this for high-dimensional systems exactly because you can't compute the Hessian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;perform a line search to determine the step size $\alpha_k$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we review two main line search methods: 
* exact line search: Armijo line search (backtracking line search) and 
* inexact line search with satisfied Wolfe conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wolfe conditions are conditions for choosing a step length, $\alpha_k$, given a descent direction $p_k$:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Armijo rule) $f(x_k + \alpha_k p_k) \le f(x_k) + c_1 \alpha_k p_k^T \Nabla f(x_k)$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(curvature condition) -p_k^T \Nabla f(x_k + \alpha_k p_k) \le -c_2 p_k^T \Nabla f(x_k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armijo rule ensures that the step length decreases f sufficiently. The curvature condition ensures that the slope has been reduced sufficiently. With the strong Wolfe conditions, there is a different curvature condition:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$|p_k^T \Nabla f(x_k + \alpha_k p_k)| \le c_2 |p_k^T \Nabla f(x_k)|$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with $0 &amp;lt; c_1 &amp;lt; c_2 &amp;lt; 1$. If $p_k$ is a descent direction, then we just need to satisfy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$p_k^T \Nabla f(x_k) &amp;lt; 0$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with $p_k = -\Nabla f(x_k)$ as the gradient direction, or with $p_k = - H^{-1} \Nabla f(x_k)$ with H being positive definite as the Newton-Raphson direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust Region Methods
The purpose of trust region methods is to define a region that is "trustworthy" to move in the direction of a local optima. The idea is to first perform a "line search" and then determine the direction of search. A trust region algorithm solves a subproblem that uses the gradient information and Hessian (or approximation) information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Constrained&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See section on Programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Zero-Finding: Newton's Method and the Secant Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Secant method
This method essentaially uses an iteration of secant lines and their roots to better approximate a root of the original function of interest, f. It is similar to a finite-difference approximation of Newton's method.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x_{k+1} = x_k - f(x_k) \frac{x_k - x_{k-1}}{f(x_k) - f(x_{k-1})}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newton's method&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$x_{k+1} = x_k - \frac{f(x_k)}{f'(x_k)}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Newton's method can be approximated when Jacobians and Hessians are too expensive, by using the class of quasi-newton methods, such as the BFGS method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testrpc is an in-memory blockchain that can be used to test the development of the application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web3 is essentially the web interface with the backend and frontend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solc is a solidity code compiler&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Truffle is a web framework for building dAPPs using Ethereum&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will install zeppelin-solidity for testing code and initialize your project directory using truffle.s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;contracts: this is your directory for any solidity contracts&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Contracts and FrontEnd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to implement your contracts and frontend to create your unique token(s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ERC Standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. ERC20&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements for it are:
- The Token’s Name
- The Token’s Symbol
- The Token’s Decimal Places
- The Number of Tokens in Circulation
- balanceOf 
- allowance
- approve 
- transferFrom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also defines two events: Transfer and Approval .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. ERC721&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are tokens that are non-fungible. One token does not necessarily equal another. It is slightly more complicated then the erc20 token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard defines the functions:
- name 
- symbol 
- totalSupply 
- balanceOf 
- ownerOf 
- approve 
- takeOwnership 
- transfer 
- tokenOfOwnerByIndex
- tokenMetadata &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also defines two events: Transfer and Approval .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can test using a web tool (solidity online compiler), hosted by the Ethereum foundation: http://remix.ethereum.org/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily test contract functionality, but beware you can't test your whole dapp functionality, so there could be bugs in synchronizing the front/back end with the contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Ropsten Test Network (https://ropsten.etherscan.io )&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using remix, or another tool to deploy your contract, you can check basic outputs here on the test network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Javascript Truffle Tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These will be customized test suites that you write in the truffle directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;npm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ethereumjs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;truffle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;develop&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;truffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;develop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This command will install the ethereum-tx package, boot a test blockchain using truffle and then run all tests within "/test/" directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Metamask and Ganache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a blockchain utility web app that can run in your web2.0 browser. It can help debug your entire dapp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ganache is a personal Ethereum development network that runs on your computer.  Using Ganache you can quickly see how your application affects the blockchain, and introspect details like your accounts, balances, contract creations and gas costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Deployment&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. truffle.js (http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside your truffle.js file, you'll find the line module.exports. You can modify the contents of this json object, to manage your deployment testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;networks: Specifies which networks are available for deployment during migrations, as well as specific transaction parameters when interacting with each network (such as gas price, from address, etc.). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;name: development, test, ropste, live, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(options): gas, gasPrice, from, provider&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;providers: Specifies the local test network. Make sure you wrap truffle-hdwallet providers in a function closure as shown below to ensure that only one network is ever connected at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;networks: {
  ropsten: {
    provider: function() {
      return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://ropsten.infura.io/");
    },
    network_id: '3',
  },
  test: {
    provider: function() {
      return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "http://127.0.0.1:8545/");
    },
    network_id: '*',
  },
}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;contracts_build_directory: for where to build the contracts into byte code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mocha: configuration options for mochajs testing framework.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can create an ethereum mnemonic and set it, so your providers can see it within the config file. Here is an example of &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;truffle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;migrate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--network ropsten&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. Crowdsalable Ethereum Token&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mkdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crowdsalable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crowdsalable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;truffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;unbox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ajb413&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;crowdsalable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;eth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;token&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Nice Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hostel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Hostel Antares&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one of the few times I've stayed in a hostel and it completely changed my mind on hostels! It was pretty clean and had AC in doors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also free wine at 7PM each day and there is an outdoor area that connects with another hostel, where you can go and cook food, hang out and meet other people. It was about 100 meters from the main train station and a short walk to the beach area. Overall, great atmosphere, living conditions and location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Castle Hill&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a sick overlook of the entire city. I spent a day just exploring this area and enjoying the views while eating a baguette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Monaco&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamouse Monaco is only a 30-40 minute train ride away and costs 6 euros round trip (if you're under 25), but really cheap no matter what! Monaco has a lot of great sights and is pretty easy to explore by foot, or by bus once you get there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware that everything in Monaco is EXTREMELY expensive, so if you want to save money, go eat on the outskirts, on the French border side, or pack some food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monaco is very small, and is separate from France, so you can easily walk between the two "countries" after getting off the train station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Promenade Des Anglais&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the walkway along the beaches of Nice. It is absolutely amazing to come both during the day and the night. The waters are light blue and the beach is made of pebbles. There are plenty of activities going on that you can pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came here and drank some wine, while just people watching for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Cannes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a 30-40 minute train ride away, but I heard that besides the Sundance festival, or if you're a family/couple, it's nothing special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Chez Moi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a smalltime french restaurant that shouldn't break the bank. Great duck! Escargot was average, but at least affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Illia Pasta&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap pasta found in one of the alleys of the old-town of Nice. It is pretty fresh and affordable (~10 euros), so enjoyed it a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chez Pipo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infamous Soca is from this area apparently. It's just basically... French pancakes, but it was really good here (and cheap)! Have it with some rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Cafe de Turin&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a seafood bar/cafe that surrounds a big square with Museums (i.e. contemporary and modern art) around the corner. It was nice to come here and grab 6 oysters, which were HUGE and pretty good. It's not extremely cheap or anything, but it's worth to come here and get some seafood to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Wine Drinking On Promenade Des Anglais:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the entire promenade, you can drink and just relax, French-style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Wayne Bar&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty popping bar area that has a lot of people from all over the world. Nice place with live music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much walk this entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Quick Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past year, I was fortunate to live in France, Europe from September 2017 till August 2018. While, I couldn't speak much French, I worked in an english speaking laboratory at Aix-Marseille Universite, under a really talented and successful professor, Dr. Viktor Jirsa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there, I had the chance to visit numerous countries and cities (I try to stay chronologically):
- London, UK
- Munich, Germany (Oktoberfest)
- Casablanca and Marrakech, Morocco
- Budapest, Hungary
- Geneva/Lausanne, Switzerland (LauzHack)
- Lyon, France
- Prague, Czech Republic
- Paris, France (Thanksgiving)
- Munich, Germany (with parents)
- Vienna, Austria
- London, UK (Christmas)
- Zurich, Switzerland (NY)
- Cambridge, UK (Cambridge Hacks)
- Berlin, Germany (Bosch Connected World Hackathon/Conference)
- Amsterdam, Netherlands (SD friends here)
- Paris, France
- Cassis, France (from Marseille)
- Amsterdam, Netherlands (Baltimore friends here)
- Barcelona, Spain
- Paris, France
- Saint Raphael, France (For TNG/INS Retreat! So fun...)
- Monaco
- Nice, France
- London -&amp;gt; Dublin, Ireland 
- Lisbon and Porto, Portugal
- London, UK (Last layover before heading home to USA)
- Tuscany and Pisa, Italy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Top Experiences&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United Kingdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Southern France&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traveling A Lot
TBD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Culture EU vs America&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture in Europe is a huge mix of different nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;America is different because we are one nation with a mix of many nationalities that came to solely LIVE in America. Honestly, we're all American. I felt more American while living abroad, then Chinese because that's who I am; that's how I grew up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politics of America in Europe is actually very well known. Everyone I knew heard about the major events in the USA. They knew a lot about Trump's policies and found it amusing that Americans had so many divisive issues that were not present in EU life. For example, they found it absurd that we have guns. Even if it is for enjoyment..., why do we need them? Even if you're a law-abiding citizen, why do you need a gun. EU citizens definitely don't see America as a great country in any aspect since Trump got elected. Most of the times the USA came up, it was with an air of humor, or mockery. To be fair, I agreed at times with them because Trump acted like a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Misc.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we share this interview in our social media posts?
Would you be okay with us writing small posts that may highlight different parts of this interview? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the most memorable part of your experience abroad?
(Telling a story and highlights of doing research abroad in an intl setting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;traveling, connecting with people from other countries and going on a lab retreat EU style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the Whitaker experience improve your research in graduate school?
(relating their exp back to the Whitaker program)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it brought a different viewpoint into my research of epilepsy seizure localization. It also exposed me to the field of computational modeling and using dynamical systems to study biological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For scientists planning on going abroad for a prolonged visit, what is some advice you would give them?
(giving some value to readers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;spend as much time as you can engaging in other researchers while you are there. Take as much time as you can to travel within the country and region also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you explain the research you undertook during your Whitaker in laymen terms and why it was important?
(education about the research to the general public that is digestable)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;simulating seizures in the brain to determine if algorithms designed on empirical data can localize the origin of these seizures in-silico.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I will attempt to give a brief introduction to the core concepts in my research and relate it to the clinical problem of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;0. Short Blurb About Brains and Network Neuroscience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the hype about "AI" and deep learning recently, it can become easy to assume that we are at the apex of our understanding of the human brain. This couldn't be farther from the truth. While we have a decent understanding of how single neurons work and how different regions of our brain work to give rise to very basic behavior (i.e. vision, movement, perception), we essentially have no knowledge as to how hundreds-millions of neurons work together, or how more complex behavior manifests (i.e. imagination, learning, etc.). We don't even know how to quantitatively diagnost epilepsy, Parkinsons disease, Alzheimers disease, or any mental disorder for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brains are inherently a complex network of highly nonlinear functions. In the past it has been easy to analyze very simple, linear "things". That is because linear means a line. If you add a lot of lines together, it is easy to predict what the result looks like. Now imagine, if instead of a line, you have a highly complex curve and you add many of these together. It quickly becomes insurmountable to imagine how this result would look like. This is exactly what happens with our brain. We initially were able to ask simple questions of the brain and get simple answers from one neuron, or one region of the brain. However, in order to tackle increasingly complex questions of the brain, we have to shift our analysis to look at the entire network of the brain. When we learn, how does the entire brain coordinate this (not just one region)? When we have neurological diseases, how does the entire brain get affected (not just one region)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there is a whole field out there growing as a result. That is called, network neuroscience; the science of analyzing how the brain works using network-based analysis (e.g. graphs, neural networks, etc.). My belief is that as our understanding of basic brain network principles improves, our ability to generate increasingly complex AI systems will also improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Epilepsy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a disease that affects more then 70 M people worldwide, which characterizes itself with seizures (i.e. abnormal brain activity) for seconds to several minutes. Epilepsy can be treated with medicine that generally inhibits brain activity (albeit with numerous side effects), and also with surgery. Surgery can involve resection (i.e. cutting a portion of the hypothesized diseased brain) and laser ablation (i.e. heat treatment of small spherical regions within the brain). When successful, surgery can result in complete seizure freedom! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the problem is that surgery is extremely variable in success (e.g. ~50% average). Imagine getting permanent brain surgery, when there is a high likelihood of you still having seizures afterwards. A main obstacle to high success rates is incorrect localization of the epileptogenic zone, the clinical region of the brain that seizures originate from. In addition, clinicians employ a strategy similar to cancer resection; they will cut out a greater portion of the brain then possibly hypothesized because it will have good "margins" on the diseased tissue. This can cause unnecessary neural dysfunction, especially when these regions are close to important areas for language, motor or executive function. The goal of any researcher in this field is to identify biomarkers and methods for robustly identifying this diseased brain region given neural data. The result would be more successful surgeries and more accurate maps, leading to less brain regions being resected. Neural data can come in the form of electrophysiological recordings, MRI images, Diffusion weighted MRI images and CT images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Computational Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational modeling is the art of using mathematical equations to model how certain systems (i.e. the brain) behaves given parameters you input. These are normally formed in the framework of differential equations (i.e. that class we took in undergrad that made us go "huh?"). So here, at Marseille, the group has developed computational models that take in the patient's specific brain imaging to model epilepsy in a patient-specific manner (i.e. personalized brain modeling). The way it does this is by parcellating the brain into multiple regions, where each region is modeled by a computational model that can exhibit certain seizure phenomena. Then, by coupling (connecting) every region based on realistic brain connectivity, you can simulate brain behavior when you "set" different regions of the brain to be "diseased" that has some form of a realistic brain network. One could then compare the simulation and the real electrophysiological recording data in patients to test different hypotheses, such as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what happens if we set this region to be epileptogenic? does it resemble the real dynamics recorded in the patient's brain? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we remove this region of the brain (i.e. remove connectivity to and from this region), will it help prevent propagation of seizure activity to healthy regions of the brain?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we generate realistic data that can reflect feature variability of the real recording data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algorithms are spelling out a certain set of computations that a program should undertake to get a specific answer. In our research group, we are attempting to develop algorithms that take in brain data of the patient and outputs a prediction of the diseased region. There are different kinds of algorithms that use the data in various ways. In general, all data analysis tries to represent data in various ways. Does the amplitude, or frequency of the data matter? Should we represent the data as a graph? Should we apply filters to the data to remove noise? Should we just leave the data alone and let the model decide what is important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research group currently developed a fast network-based algorithm that analyzes the data as a graph by applying a very specific type of computation. Namely, it constructs a graph out of the dataset and applies perturbations to the graph (i.e. add's vectors of noise in a very structured way), to determine which regions of the brain are most susceptible to being perturbed into seizing. This specific type of analysis requires some simple linear systems theory to derive an analytical equation for doing this. It was biologically inspired and can be read in some of the reference publications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum, one could apply deep learning to this problem for a way of supervised learning. What this would require is knowing the exact regions of the brain that are diseased and then feeding in the data and the labels of the regions to let the model determine which features of the data are most predictive of the diseased region. This is more general, but can require large amounts of data and hyperparameter tuning of the neural networks. In addition, epilepsy data has the problem of "noisy labeling". Clinicians are never sure where exactly the EZ is, so even if we have a significant amount of patients, our training data for deep learning are not optimal. Contrast this with the infamous case of recognizing "cats vs dogs", where I am pretty positive most cats are definitely correctly labeled as cats, and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Research Project Concepts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I attempt to explain some of the high level concepts that motivated the research I am carrying out that integrates network analysis, computational modeling and deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. The Virtual Brain (TVB) vs Network Data Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the main project proposed when I applied for the Whitaker/Chateaubriand fellowships. The goal was to use the flexible modeling capabilities of "The Virtual Brain" (TVB) platform developed here in Marseille to understand how network data predictions of the epileptogenic zone performs under various model configurations. So, how can our predictions work under various clinical settings? Can we arrive at the same conclusion when our algorithm is applied to an in-silico model?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to demonstrate agreement by using this whole-brain model helps provide evidence on two fronts: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provides additional evidence that TVB is capable of modeling the dynamical characteristics of seizures realistically and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;provide hypothetical constraints on data analysis by providing ground-truth simulations of epileptic seizures and demonstrating when the algorithms work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Work&lt;/strong&gt;
By using a patient's individual neuroimaging scans, and their actual recorded epileptic seizures, we can 1) create a personalized brain from those scans and 2) analyze their electrophysiological recordings with our network-based algorithm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the personalized brain, we can use TVB as a software platform to simulate signals that we hypothesize might come from different regions of that patient's brain. If we fix all parameters, and then systematically change which region of the brain is epileptic, then we can form a suite of datasets where we know the epileptic region(s). This would not be possible with real data because we never know for sure which region of the brain is epileptic! So assuming this model is accurate to some degree in replicating features of the  brain's electrophysiology, we can compare the results of the network-based analysis for each simulated dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tools from statistics, we can statistically compare the different results from our algorithm to the real data. The results that are closest to our real data suggest that this is the region most likely to be actually epileptic. This region was where we set as epileptic in the software and was capable of producing the simulated data that best represented the real data; in other words, it is a measure of how similar our simulations are to real data under different hypotheses of epileptic regions. This presents a framework to systematically produce an estimate of the real epileptic region in a patient, and also to study situations in which our network-based algorithm can fail. It is a "step" towards opening the black box, which is the patient's brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Using TVB To Augment Neural Datasets For Deep Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A core problem of deep learning is the amount of data required to train successful models to perform classification/regression. Generally, more data means more variation in your dataset, thus having a higher likelihood of capturing the true underlying distribution of all possible data. This is especially apparent in models surrounding neuroscience and neural data. That is because neural data is traditionally difficult to obtain, and is extremely constrained because of the different variables that go into collecting the data in a clinical setting. Clinical procedures can vary, recording electrodes can be implanted in various places of the brain, brains vary structurally from patient to patient, brains vary functionally from patient to patient, and different regions of the brain are epileptic from patient to patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TVB at its core is a model of the brain that utilizes realistic brain geometry, connectivity and clinical hypotheses to simulate electrophysiological signals. Based on the model, it can generate different patterns of behavior, or in our case, epileptic seizures. This is extremely important because as a scientist, you can control the variables to produce different types of data, but all demonstrating epileptic seizing. This hypothetically would give you a huge amount of variable data, that has ground truth set by you, and also only require computing power to simulate. It is not constrained by medical procedures and could help in generating data that deep learning models can learn from for each patient BEFORE surgery. This could help establish a completely computerized pipeline for helping clinicians make informed decisions and hypotheses before the patient is operated on with the help of deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Work&lt;/strong&gt;
Using a batch of real recording data from patients, we can construct a deep learning model that learns some useful classification from the data. For example, which region is "epileptic", or when is the patient seizing? However, in order to be fair, your training of the model will always use a leave-one-patient out scheme because you have to assume you do not have access to a patient's data before making predictions on that specific patient. This brings up a lot of problems though! Even if we have "a lot" of data, there are so many clinical variables (brought up earlier) that can cause variations in how the test patient's data will look compared to your training data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my proposal is to use TVB as a way of constructing the personalized brain model for a patient, and then simulating a highly variable dataset by varying parameters. Although it is highly possible that parts of this dataset is not fully realistic or representative of real data, it gives a way of generating significant amounts of data and a way of generating data points that are closer representations in terms of the patient's specific brain structure, connections, and electrode implantation schema. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I test the potential for this by performing a set of experiments using a standard neural network trained only on the real data, vs trained on the real data AND the simulated dataset from the test patient's specific brain model. Initial results show improved convergence of training, but more work needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions / Future Considerations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning to JHU, I have a lot of things to accomplish before being able to graduate with my PhD. Although spending this year may have increased my timeline to graduation, it also expanded my research scope and scientific knowledge. This is exciting to me because a PhD is not just about quickly graduating, but about developing a broad range of deep skills that allow you to make impacts on a variety of different problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is only a small subset of the many unsolved neurological disorders out there. By tackling a very specific problem in the brain, I will hope to build fundamental understanding that translates to understanding other brain disorders. Specifically in the future, I am interested in Alzheimers disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Random Notes on This Year, Data and PhD Research&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I really had to deal with more data then I was accustomed to at JHU. At JHU, I had access to various text files, EEG recordings and MRI/CT imaging data for various patients from various clinical centers. However, these recordings were never longer then 5-10 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I had to begin dealing with data at larger scales. I had to understand how to optimize parallelized runs of linear algorithms on said data. My datasets went from a couple hundred MB (i.e. few recordings for a single patient), to a few GB (i.e. multiple patients) to a couple hundred GB and few TBs (i.e. &amp;gt;50 patients with multiple recordings). My analysis and data pipeline design scaled at the same time, but required me to refactor and understand how to continuously analyze the data robustly and efficiently. I complain a lot about having to refactor code (since it's not really research), but I think there is a lot to be learned by having to independently design, implement and test your own data pipelines as your data/analysis becomes more and more complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started out with analyzing datasets on my laptop/workstation with unoptimized code. Then I proceeded to optimize different parts of my workflow and moduralize it, so that it could be parallelized onto multiple cores. I then proceeded to submit it onto the JHU Maryland High-Performance Computing cluster. At the same time, I ended up learning a lot more about Unix and terminal-based commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data Pipeline Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, I began with one CPU per window of data (each dataset was split into a number of windows to analyze). This resulted in hundreds-thousands of CPUs being fired up with loading the data and then analyzing a short segment of the dataset. This had numerous problems. One CPU out of hundreds/thousands could easily fail the run the job correctly, which would result in a missing computed window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, I began using a parallel framework with GNU that ran each dataset with a fixed 24 cores per node. This helped because GNU allows you to restart jobs using a log file, but this was also problematic because as datasets grew longer, it wasn't clear how long I would have to wait to get data per each patient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, I also break up datasets into chunks and then analyze using 24-48 cores at a time that sift through the data. These data analyzed-chunks can later be combined to form into the one dataset if necessary, but a metadata json object is used to store information allowing anyone using the data to understand how to put computations together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PhD and Research Understanding&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of this year was spent reading papers and doing a lot of thinking... Not very productive, but I really felt like I learned a lot and expanded my research mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple things I started learning more about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. reading papers is good to do on a consistent basis, but focus on getting to the core of the "key" papers (how you decide which papers are key comes with exp)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized that some papers are great to learn and skim through the results and methods to understand how they did it, what are the limitations and what was innovated on. Then there are other papers that introduce a completely new concept that might be different. These papers are important to understand because they usually spur papers down the road that require you to understand this one. I tend to go through the figures and equations multiple times to understand the details of the motivation, methods and results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. software engineering is very important in data analysis.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps you formulate and design a software package that is intended to "experiment" the different parameters, datasets, and visualize results in an end-to-end fashion; it ideally would allow you to "press run" while you read papers, go out drinking, or go traveling. I probably refactored my code around 5-6 times this year, which was a great learning experience, but it took a lot of time. It helped me understand the scope of my projects and will hopefully be helpful down the road in my ambition to become a data and machine learning expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. it's easy to get stuck in a loop of feeling like "you're not going anywhere".&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research takes time and whether it's analyzing data, thinking of a math problem, understanding an experiment, or testing a computational model, it can become easy to think you're making no progress. It is extremely important to set mini-goals (e.g. weekly) on top of your milestone goals (e.g. monthly, or few months). You want to also allow yourself room to learn how to set these goals realistically. At the beginning, you'll think that you are capable of accomplish ABC...Z in one week. Most of the time, this ends up being overly optimistic. As you grow, you start to realize what is realistically accomplishable on a week-to-week basis. This helps you scope out each week and plan accordingly to make incremental progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if your results don't pan out, this helps build a mindset of systematic thinking. You want to plan mini-experiments on your analysis that will provide you with the next step to pursue. The analysis did not work the way you expect? Okay, then we probably need to test these factors and visualize data over the next week. Okay if those factors will take too long, we should back up and clean up our approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big international airport that you can get RT bus tickets to the city for 12 euros. It takes about 30-40 minutes and runs pretty frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I only spent 2 days here, and I think it's not worth anymore then that, unless you are planning daytrips from Dublin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Guiness St. James Gate Brewery&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Barcelona Airport (BCN)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a large international airport that has a metro service to the city (which I recommend you to just buy a multi-day pass, since it covers your exit from the airport). This is great because you don't have to worry about finding a bus, or taxi, or uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has buses that run towards the city, which might be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. La Sagrada Familia&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be considered an eighth wonder of the world. It is definitely one of the most popular attractions and is well worth the ticket. It is an architectural phenomenon designed by Gaudi, the famous architect. It's been under construction for a long time....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Parc Guell&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a famous nice park. You need to book tickets ahead of time to get into the most iconic area, but the rest of the park is open all day. The actual inside of the park is open at 6AM and free until 8AM, but then tickets run all day. There is a limited supply, so you definitely need to buy these ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Arc de Triomf&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just the famouse Spanish Arc. It's a nice park and walkway area to hang out and have a picnic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Bunkers Del Carmel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Mount Tibidabo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've ever watched friends, this is the setting of one of Joey's infamous pick up lines. But for real, it's actually a really nice mountain to hike up to and their is an observatory and an amusement park at the top! Check online for the trolley schedule that brings you up the mountain, else you will have to definitely hike it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Tapas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian food is big in the Netherlands because they used to be a trading country. A lot of places can be overpriced though (even if they are good), but I found this place to be fairly priced and actually very great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Seafood Market (La Paradeta)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh seafood that is bought by the gram. They cook it in simple options (e.g. with tomato sauce, or just steamed, or raw) and then call your number. It is legit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://xceed.me/blog/en/best-night-clubs-in-barcelona/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Opium Nightclub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More edm/top 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Pacha Nightclub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your spanish / latin music night club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Shoko Nightclub&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanish / edm / top 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Gothic Quarter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this nice area to walk in with a bunch of shops, bars, restaurants scattered throughout. It is an extremely old area and feels like you're walking almost in historical times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can definitely use the metro system in Barcelona! I recommend buying the multi-day passes. &lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2018-05-01:/blog/2018/05/travel-barcelona/</guid><category>travel</category><category>europe</category><category>spain</category><category>barcelona</category></item><item><title>Travel - Amsterdam</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2018/04/travel-amsterdam/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Europe - Amsterdam, Netherlands&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Schipol Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a large international airport that has a train service to the Amsterdam Centraal station in the center of Amsterdam. It costs ~5 euros to buy a ticket, but the ticket booths only accept credit cards with a pin number, so you may need to go to the actual ticket office to buy yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Else it costs around 30 euros to uber from the center of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend buying a metro pass here if you can for the length of your stay because it gives you access to all the buses and trams in the city (which are very frequent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airport is rather efficient, so I was able to get through security and check into a lounge always after arriving 1 hour early (assuming you don't have bag check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. De Gooyer Windmill (and Brewery!)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an old windmill that was renovated to become a brewery at the bottom. Come here and take a photo of the picturesque windmill and have some great locally brewed beers! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brewery is only open till 8PM though. There is also a great burrito (Burrito Annonymous) place across the street, which is great if you're missing Mexican food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Red Light District&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex shows, prostitutes in windows, sex shops and a very red lit district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Van Gogh Museum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You DEFINITELY have to book your tickets in advance. It is well worth it because you get 4 floors of Van Gogh as he progresses through his short life. He was only 27 when he began painting! Yet, he became one of the most famous artists in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went, they also have other artists there who were an inspiration, or part of Van Gogh's life. Great for impressionist/portrait lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Rijksmuseum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went, you could still buy tickets at the office outside near the IAmsterdam sign, but a lot of people recommend buying online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great museum that houses some of the famous Dutch painters, most famously Rembrandt. He painted a lot of great portraits, with the most well-known being "The Nights Watch" (cue GoT fans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Anne-Frank House&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth visiting, and you HAVE TO buy tickets in advance. I think the worth behind this is self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Indonesian Food (Cafe Kadijk)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian food is big in the Netherlands because they used to be a trading country. A lot of places can be overpriced though (even if they are good), but I found this place to be fairly priced and actually very great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Seafood Bar (Spui)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seafood market that has fresh seafood and amazing chefs. Extremely worth your money, but make sure you make a reservation by stopping by, or through their website! (http://www.theseafoodbar.com/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Stroopwafels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect for dipping in your coffee and for buying as a gift for colleagues, friends and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Rembrandt Square&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A square with a bunch of cafes and bars around the entire square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Shelter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very famous house/techno club that will probably require you to buy tickets to get in, but it is a very cool Amsterdam experience. I also really like the music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Jimmy Woos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an American style club that will probably play EDM/HipHop and is styled with an Asian theme. Pretty cool, and they also have a lot of bars around the area. There is a bar across the street from the entrance that has live music and cheap drinks for a 2 euro entrance fee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can definitely use the tram/bus system in Amsterdam! I recommend buying the multi-day passes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is completely walking the city (uhh), or renting a bike and getting around like the locals do.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 28 Apr 2018 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2018-04-28:/blog/2018/04/travel-amsterdam/</guid><category>travel</category><category>europe</category><category>netherlands</category><category>amsterdam</category></item><item><title>Setting Up Singularity Containers</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2018/01/setup-singularity/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Getting Setup with Singularity&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install singularity locally with root privelages, you can then build up containers that can be hosted online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Setting Up A Tensorflow Container Recipe (Example):&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;docker&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nl"&gt;From&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gpu&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;SHELL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SHELL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%setup&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# runs on host - the path to the image is $SINGULARITY_ROOTFS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%post&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# post-setup script&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# load environment variables&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# use bash as default shell&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SHELL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# make environment file executable&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;chmod&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;environment&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# default mount paths&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clean&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;apt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;libcupti&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;keras&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;pip3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scipy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scikit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;learn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tensorboard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;natsorted&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tqdm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%runscript&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# executes with the singularity run command&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# delete this section to use existing docker ENTRYPOINT command&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nf"&gt;%test&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="cp"&gt;# test that script is a success&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;1. Needed Docker Containers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best thing to do is start off with a docker container that is already prebuilt. The nice thing is that for cloud computing with tensorflow-gpu, tensorflow is maintained on docker and up to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Docker&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;From&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;latest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gpu&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other options are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;shub&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;From&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. Environment / Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are commands that can be used to export variables into the environment. Then you can run setup of files/variables before running any installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main area where your image will install different packages and load different environment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Run Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will run a script afterwards, say a scientific experiment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--args&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;5. Test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will run test scripts to see that your "main.py" did what it was supposed to do. Were files saved? Were computations correct?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Common Commands&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling images, shelling into the image and executing the image with a script&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;singularity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pull&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;singularity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;shell&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;singularity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Common argument flags:
* verbose mode(s): -v, -vv, -vvv
* debug mode: -d 
* link nvidia driver &amp;amp; GPU: --nv
* binds an existing directory onto the image: -B&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example use case that runs a tensorflow simg and runs a training script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;singularity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;exec&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;nv&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tensorflow&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;simg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt; ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;traindatadir&lt;/span&gt;} ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;testdatadir&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;output_data_dir&lt;/span&gt; ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;outputdatadir&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;log_data_dir&lt;/span&gt; ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;logdatadir&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;patient_to_loo&lt;/span&gt; ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;patient&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;expname&lt;/span&gt; ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;expname&lt;/span&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows an end-to-end HPC/scientific computation analysis that uses Docker/Singularityhub to setup your system, and then runs setup, main scripts and testing to create a consistent output.&lt;/p&gt;

Every new years goals post seems to be written just a few days ago in my head. This year was filled with transitions, both personal and professional. I started off the year living in France, and traveling to Switzerland to see how a NYE abroad would be like. The time abroad up until August was an experience that really taught me how to survive in a completely different country without a cohort of students around me, or a friend group from college for support. I did a lot of traveling in Europe, seeing countries and cities that I've never been to, such as Hungary, Portugal, Morocco and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professionally, I grew in ways that I did not expect. Rather then going to the EMBC conference with the rest of my lab, I went to a computationally focused neuroscience conference in Seattle. I reconnected with my high school friends and some old friends from JHU. The time there was perfect and a fond way for me to transition my life back into the USA. My time spent with the Theoretical Neurosciences Group helped me grow as an independent thinker and researcher. I developed a distinct appreciation for how mathematics can drive precise and beautiful descriptions of biological systems. I did some explicit exploration of using deep learning to understand its classification capabilities, and also see the pitfalls that occur when designing an architecture, or training scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2018 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Travel [X]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I traveled a lot last year. Currently this year, I've visited London, Paris, Lyon, Marrackech, Casablanca, Munich, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Lausanne, Geneva, Cambridge, Nice, Monaco, Barcelona, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Porto, Tuscany, Qatar, Seoul, Busan, Hanoi, Lanhah Bay, Ho Chi Minh City and Columbus (Ohio). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my travel goals for this year are two parts:
i. I'm going to try to visit:
Lisbon [ ], 
Oslo [ ], 
Helsinki [ ], 
Stockholm [ ], 
Istanbul [ ], 
Athens [ ], 
Santorini [ ],
Croatia [ ], 
Luxembourg [ ], 
Bordeaux [ ], 
Berlin [ ], 
Frankfurt [ ], 
Rome [ ] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. The things I'm going to try to attend are Tomorrowland 2018 [ ] and Yacht week 2018 [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Academic [X]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I submitted a conference paper on using research I did in France, using a computational modeling platform to study algorithmic performance of seizure localization in epilepsy patients. I submitted a poster for some preliminary work on combining training from empirical data and simulated data to improve seizure detection. This was a completely independent idea that I only had after spending some time working in France. I enrolled in Matrix Theory when I got back to JHU and really enjoyed delving deeper into the mathematical theory behind matrices and linear algebra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year holds a lot of potential. I'll be submitting a journal paper for a complete retrospective study on the fragility algorithm [ ], which will be part of my main thesis work. I'm going to be enrolled in Linear Systems Theory to understand more theory behind our work in the NCSL lab. I will also attempt to audit an optimization course with a focus on theory to better understand some of the core optimization algorithms that take place in machine learning and statistical modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Professional [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to submit applications for internships, but I feel like research is always going on and interrupting the flow of things. My goal here was to submit applications to DE Shaw LLC, DE Shaw Research, Google Brain Research Team, DeepMind, Facebook Research, Amazon Data Science, Amazon Health Research. In all fairness, things were hectic with life as I had to transition between living in France back to JHU. I can still do this, but I hope that I can achieve that this fall, when things have settled at JHU and my PhD is nearing its end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python review of data structures [ ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of machine learning basics, such as backpropagation, convolutional networks, lstm network, logistic regression, linear regression, expectation maximization scheme [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Personal [X]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanted to do more photography, but my camera got stolen halfway into the year (RIP). However, I splurged and got an even better setup! The Sony a6500, will hopefully allow me to go even further with night shots, portraits and landscapes during this year. Also managed to hit benching of 225.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to reach a 
- a deadlift of 275 [ ] and 
- consistent running of 1-5 miles (by the end of the year) [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Cooking and Lifestyle [X]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managed to start cooking a lot in France. Once I returned to JHU, I started cooking pretty lean at nighttime with a spinach, salmon and chicken breast with garlic combinations. I also started making kale smoothies on a daily routine, which has been a life changer. Who knew pumping your body with greens and some ginger in the morning, concealed with the sugar of frozen fruits would feel and taste so good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Reading and Knowledge [X]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've tried to take on more reading about new topics that I find interesting, such as politics and blockchain technologies. I started using Pocket, which is a great resource for saving webpages for easy reading offline at a later time! Will continue to do so on topics related to blockchain scaling, right and left-wing politics, and machine learning in industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Resolutions for 2019:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Learning Mandarin Chinese - Simplified [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling to a Mandarin speaking country, Taiwan with my friends made me realize my Chinese is horrendous. I always went to China with my family, and I never had to get around by myself. This was the first time I wanted to rely on my Chinese to communicate with strangers, and get around the country, but I realized my speaking and reading ability is just not up to par. This year, I'm committed to speaking to my parents in as much Chinese as possible and I've even started a Wechat/Messenger/Line group chat with my Chinese friends to practice Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Bartending Basic Drinks and Theory [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a bartending kit on Amazon and am aiming to learn how to make some basic drinks like an old fashioned, mojito and other drinks I can find online. Aiming to learn how to make 6 good drinks by the years end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Continuation of Lifestyle Changes [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting my own hair, benching 2 plates, reaching deadlift of 3 plates and running at least 5 miles per week. Been proud of myself for learning how to cut my own hair (thus saving time and money each month), and hitting a bench press of 2 plates, while still weighing 160 lbs. This year I hope to continue my fitness goals and potentially shave off 10-15 lbs to a flat 145-150 lb. This will be achieved with the help of my nifty Apple Watch Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Professional Improvements and Consolidation of Technical Skills [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I'll be making a lot of strides in my professional career. On one hand, I'll be pursuing the development of a startup company that is a result of my PhD research. My PI and I will be developing a seizure localization software that outperforms anything on the market, or in academic research. Interestingly it is not based on deep learning ;). This means that I will have the opportunity to actually experience developing and designing software that complies with a 510K FDA approved software device. The software must be usable by clinicians, which will involve production level coding in Python. I look forward to learning while developing with our software engineering consultants (who definitely know more about production level coding). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the ideal goal is to be able to sell our technology by the years end to a larger EEG based company who can scale and distribute the technology into the clinic fast. Even if this doesn't happen, I believe there are still many important lessons to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this endeavor, I aim to showcase to myself and others that I am capable of designing and implementing a production level software system that can sit in a clinical center that pulls data, formats data properly, preprocesses it, runs an optimized parallelized algorithm for analysis and outputs high-grade visualizations that are clinically useful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I want to practice more of my coding skills with data structures and basic algorithms using LeetCode. So far, I've done 20-30 excercises and they are actually quite interesting to sit through. Upon reading the solutions, I always learn something new in terms of how to think like an experienced programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Improving Photography With New IG Page [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I'm going to try to post new photos to a new instagram blog page with more travel related photos. This is to sort of separate my personal instagram from my photography hobby. I have a lot more to learn about optimal lighting and photography of different scenes (e.g. portraits, landscapes, nightshots). I am aiming to post an additional 12 photos that I am proud of onto this IG page by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See link to keep up to dates with my adventure!

&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Lucerne (Luzern)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucerne is a great small town that can be a base for you to visit Mount Pilatus, and Mount Rigi. It is very nice and has a nice looking bridge called "Chapel Bridge" and a cool monument called the Injured Lion Statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Mount Pilatus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this climb to the top by cable car is really worth it. It will cost you about ~50 CF total round trip, but at the top there is a hotel for skiiers in the winter and also has a beautiful view of Lucerne and the surrounding area from the top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cool walking area that can take you inside the mountain peak for different vantage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Zurich&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. Rhine Falls (Neuhausen)
Amazing waterfall area that is only a 30 minute train ride away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. Uetilburg
A very nice mountain hiking area that is only a 20 minute train ride out of the city. It features a nice overlook of Zurich and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iii. Fifa Museum
This shows all the history behind the FIFA organization. Very cool place to check out for any soccer fans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Geneva&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. CERN
This is where the infamous Hadron Collider is! This is where the Higgs Boson was discovered, and where there is very important physics research going on everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp. Just FYI, food in Switzerland is crazy expensive! They have such a high standard of living, I went out to eat a basic Chinese meal and it cost me $40...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Volkshaus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice night club with 3 different rooms for 3 differnet music types. Needs cash only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Langstrasse Street&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a street within Zurich that features many bars and clubs for all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around would be the SBB trains and possibly uber. The trains go over the entire country, so this is extremely worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Should I get a Swiss Travel Pass?
This depends on where you are staying and how long you are staying in Switzerland! The minimum multi-day pass is 3 days, so this is definitely worth it if you say plan on going to 3 different mountains because it covers your fee for all the trains and also the cable cars up, which can get pretty expensive!&lt;/li&gt;

This assumes that the reader has heard of cryptocurrency and might have the most basic understanding of its underlying technology. I do not presume to be an expert in cryptography, blockchain, the internet, or anything for that matter. I simply wish to express my views for the sake of learning from other’s viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Personal View on Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin is going to change the world.” A few words that I heard in 2014 at a startup conference that stuck with me for the next few years. As an engineer, I looked into bitcoin, blockchain and the technologies that began making headlines (e.g. ethereum, litecoin, etc.). My research led me to make investments into cryptocurrency. However, with the recent explosion of Bitcoin throughout the media, I formed a more rigorous hypothesis that led me to question mainstream thinking. Basing my thoughts on a semi-technical understanding of blockchain and basic economics knowledge, I arrive at three main argument points on the validity of bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will bitcoin be able to become a currency that is widely used? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will bitcoin become a valued asset that yields significant dividends? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will bitcoin become a mode of intermediate to long term value storage like gold? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I address all three points from what I have researched and experienced with the conclusion that bitcoin is not worth the financial hype. (Similar blockchain technologies like ethereum are another topic for another time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do my best to break each general question into a series of hierarchical simple questions. These will guide my thinking and I hope I can convince to come to the same conclusions I have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Bitcoin Become a Largely Used Currency?:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society uses currency as a way of exchanging value and goods. Traditionally we defined goods as perhaps a cow, spices or leather goods. Instead of trading refined tea leaves for a pair of leather shoes, we come to an agreement on a common value holder. We agree that tea leaves are worth $X and therefore one would be willing to trade leather shoes for $X knowing that they can then use $X to buy tea leaves. We need currency because this enables this fundamental exchange of goods and services. Now enters bitcoin. A disruptor within the currency world. A David to the US dollar’s Goliath. It becomes easy to be blinded by the trillions of value that the USD holds, whether it is in retirement funds, or global banks. As a currency, it is necessary that there is universal usage and stability. Having USD is only valuable because there are many people that are willing to exchange goods and services for it because they know that it has a universal value. The USD is stable in that purchasing goods for $10 one day probably means that those goods are still worth $10 the next. Bitcoin is slightly flawed and different in a few ways that are important to note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that Bitcoin has wild fluctuations in pricing. If people are buying into bitcoin believing it can be the currency of the next-generation and this causes massive fluctuations, then this is inherently contradictory. No one will use Bitcoin as a currency if buying goods for 5 Bitcoin costs 1 Bitcoin, or 200 Bitcoins in the next hour. This then leads to the next point of Bitcoin as having universal usage. While it is true that Bitcoin overcomes many barriers in global transactions that current transaction systems have, it still will not become universally accepted. It has the technical features that can allow it to be easily universally accepted, but it is up to society to implement paths to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment. However, in order to be universally accepted as a currency, it has to demonstrate that it can function as a currency. This leads to a circular dependency that will be hard to solve given Bitcoin’s limited functionality. Without true universal usage and stability, Bitcoin will not be able to achieve status as a widely used currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Bitcoin Become a Dividend Yielding Asset?:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks and bitcoin dreamers have one thing in common. Their value is tied to the assets and value that they provide society. We buy equity in Amazon because we think their value will increase in the future. We think that because we believe their total market cap (valuation) will continue growing. Bitcoin has been touted to possibly be able to act as a secure, fast, and robust transaction system. Many people buy into bitcoin because they think it will accumulate future value. This is falsely over exaggerated. Bitcoin as of now and the foreseeable future is only capable of creating value in society for certain transactions. Its use in society would be to provide services as a transaction system. If we buy in believing that we will get a return on investment, then we believe that its service provided will continue to increase in value. So this argument line is predicated on the ability of bitcoin to increase its value add as a transaction system to society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting into the technical details of bitcoin and blockchain, I present three examples of how this is highly unlikely. Firstly, bitcoin transactions are currently dependent on expensive hardware, which incur large electricity bills. This builds a reliance on centralized mining organizations formed and it is important to note that much of the computing power is located in China, under the jurisdiction of the government there. This demonstrates two unintentional flaws in the bitcoin network: centralization and unlikely scalability. Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized to incur all the benefits that would come with it (I would encourage everyone to do their own research into this, since it is a complex topic itself). However, due to the nature of mining on the bitcoin network, mining organizations have formed, which inherently form centralized hubs of bitcoin network computing. Secondly, bitcoin scalability heavily relies on expensive hardware, which is not readily accessible by the average consumer. The idea of scaling bitcoin, so that it is completely decentralized with most consumers contributing to the network to process transactions is flawed. Most average users will not buy expensive hardware to contribute to the bitcoin network and those that do will most likely join a mining organization, thereby preventing scalability and decentralization. This in turn argues against the idea that bitcoin has a future value tied to its ability to become a largely implemented transaction system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might ask how Bitcoin might overcome this reliance on expensive hardware to solve these downstream problems? There has been online conversations of changing the Bitcoin network’s internal infrastructure. Currently bitcoin uses a very secure algorithm called, Proof-of-work (PoW), which relies on a lot of heavy computing power to process transactions. There are other algorithms that have been in academic research, and have shown improved scalability and speed. One such example is Proof-of-stake (PoS), which has been shown to be just as secure under certain assumptions. The largest difference is that PoS will not rely on heavy computing power, thus enabling the average consumer to become part of the blockchain network and extinguish the need for centralized mining organizations. However, Bitcoin has shown that it will not take action to implement any changes like this. Unfortunately, the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has faded into the shadows in terms of contributing a voice to the direction of Bitcoin. Thus, there is no evangelist that can lead the charge in voicing necessary changes to the Bitcoin network. Most users and developers on the network have differing views on how Bitcoin can be improved, but without a centralized leader to take charge on these improvements, they are unlikely to occur. A slight tangential example can be seen in Ethereum, where the creator and evangelist of Ethereum has taken a strong voice in leading the most important improvements to Ethereum. If Bitcoin chooses to implement various changes to the network, then it is quite possible by that time, there are new cryptocurrencies that were built and designed to overcome these various challenges from the start. Then one might ask, what is the point of owning Bitcoin over these other coins that actually have more potential value add to society? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Bitcoin Become an Intermediate/Long Term Value Storage?:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final view on Bitcoin is slightly related to its potential as a currency, but with some differences. A value storage asset is something like a house, gold, or jewelry, where the value is retained over time (or grows for that matter). The primary necessity for any value storage are liquidity and a limited supply. Gold and Bitcoin both have fundamental economics that drive their pricing. There is a limited supply, and demand for this supply will determine its pricing. We have talked about how demand for this supply might come in the form of using it as a currency, or holding it as a value-incurring asset. Now, I discuss a related point of using Bitcoin as a vehicle for storing value. For any average consumer, putting money into gold means that you want to be able to extract the value of that money at any time, and expect similar, if not grown value. This is similar to its properties as a currency. Gold is an example of a liquid investment because it is able to be sold easily at any time and maintains a relatively stable pricing. This is contrary to Bitcoin, where prices fluctuate wildly and it is not as easily converted into cash. It is true that there are now many Bitcoin exchanges where Bitcoin can be sold and converted into cash. However, these are subject to centralized regulations from governments. For example, just recently, China enforced some heavy regulations that shut down cryptocurrency operations within the country. So even though consumers can directly use the Bitcoin network to liquidate their Bitcoin investment, it is highly unlikely that many consumers will have the tools and knowledge to be able to do so. Thus, they rely on these centralized exchanges that have been shown to be subject to the whims of the local government. Although Bitcoin has a limited supply, it has unintended flaws in its liquidity that do not allow it to become an attractive vehicle for long term value storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, to a problem with liquidity, there is a problem with competition. In rare metals, like gold and platinum, there are no gold replicas, or platinum replicas; there is only gold and platinum. With bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there is an explosion in different implementations and designs that seek to improve on the original bitcoin. These create digital competitions in the sense that, we cannot have multiple “irreplaceable digital gold.” This is inherently contradictory, and so the argument that bitcoin can be a replacement for gold does not hold true because of these alternative coins that have more or less the same functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions and Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've discussed three viewpoints of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency: i) usage as a currency, ii) a dividend-yielding asset, and iii) a "digital gold" as a value storage. While all these points of view have some valid arguments in favor of Bitcoin, they have some underlying flaws that are hard to solve. They are hard to solve because of numerous reasons, but in my opinion, it is due to the way Bitcoin was originally designed and it's mechanisms for change. I think that a truly successful cryptocurrency will be able to encompass all three viewpoints by not only having a well-thought-out initial design, but also a robust mechanism for changing the blockchain operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has a lot of problems. Nonetheless, it is the first mainstream technology of its kind, and it will spur a generation of technologies that will change the world for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

I turned the big 2 5 (yay 1 year older). However, this year came with a lot of fun as I spent time at Coachella 2017, made it out for birthdays of my friends in Vegas, spent time in SF, LA, SD and Chicago visiting old friends, enjoyed new time with Hopkins friends in NYC, Boston and DC, and spent a lot of time enjoying my "relative" last year in Baltimore. I was fortunate enough to win three prestigious fellowships: the NSF-GRFP, Whitaker and Chateaubriand fellowships. I presented two conference papers at two different conferences, where I was even able to make a trip through Korea and Japan come out of it. It's ending with me being in France working with the Theoretical Neurosciences Group in Marseille. I am incredibly fortunate to be working in a group of extraordinary people from all different countries and backgrounds. I am learning so much and developing new ideas that I honestly can't say I would've had if I were just back in Baltimore. I think I have some explicit goals this year related to my work because I find it fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2017 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is actually something I thought would impact me a lot. I still watch hella dance vids online and keep up with hip hop news here and there, but I haven't touched the dance floor in a few months and it almost feels normal now. I get my daily excercise and I'm driven by my research and learning opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah I don't know if this will ever happen... So maybe I'll aim to do a 5k next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Read four new books: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always learn from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to be able to deadlift 245, and bench 205 this year. I've also started working out in the morning, or at least daily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I moved to France and have been traveling my ass off. I don't intend on stopping and I've found that I started to become more comfortable with just being by myself. You really learn a lot when you have to handle everything from beginning to end without a friend/family member watching your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Begin to learn French: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Duolingo and got to 2% fluency. Hell yeah. Well... I'm in France, so I started now LOL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was so set on the idea of data science last year, but it's all related to my interest in medicine, tech, and AI. I've been reading more papers here and there about random things ranging from deep neural networks, matrix perturbation theory, to deep reinforcement learning. None directly relate to my rsearch, but it's fascinating and great to think about how it can continue to impact my research and future growth as a data scientist / engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah I don't know why I thought this was feasible during a PhD. However, I've built a Node.js/D3.js web app at Lauz Hack this year! I'll be building my skills further as I design a complete system for data input, data analysis and data visualization for clinical usage within a Phase I clinical trial, that I will be helping lead in the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2018 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Travel [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be spending another 6-9 months in Marseille, France. I truly enjoy having this opportunity to live in Europe for not just one semester, but one year. However, I don't think I will ever choose to live here long term, so I want to take advantage of the majority of the time I have left here and go traveling... A LOT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently this year, I've visited London, Paris, Lyon, Marrackech, Casablanca, Munich, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Lausanne, Geneva, Cambridge, Oxford, Whales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my travel goals for this year are two parts:
i. I'm going to try to visit:
Lisbon [ ], 
Oslo [ ], 
Helsinki [ ], 
Stockholm [ ], 
Nice [ ], 
Monaco [ ], 
Istanbul [ ], 
Athens [ ], 
Santorini [ ],
Croatia [ ], 
Barcelona [ ], 
Amsterdam [ ], 
Luxembourg [ ], 
Bordeaux [ ], 
Berlin [ ], 
Frankfurt [ ], 
Rome [ ], 
Bologna [ ], &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. The things I'm going to try to attend are Tomorrowland 2018 [ ] and Yacht week 2018 [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Academic [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been able to finish two conference papers, and a journal paper as first author. I've also served as an author on two additional conference papers. This upcoming year, I want to delve deeper into the intersection of my current work with machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to submit two conference papers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on initial results of fragility tested on TVB and [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial results of a DNN tested on TVB for seizure detection. [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to submit a journal paper for a complete retrospective study on the fragility algorithm [ ] and an Bayesian inference implementation of the final layer of prediction of the EZ set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to enroll in a class on Matrix Theory, Stochastic Optimization and Nonlinear Optimization. These are three topics I feel like I have to understand at a deeper level to fundamentally be able to tackle many generic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Professional [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the time is approaching when I will be thinking about graduation from the PhD program at JHU. It feels like a lifetime ago that I was a nervous wreck joining JHU and wondering if I was smart enough to keep up with some of the cutting edge research in BME. I think I still have some issues with where I feel in terms of knowledge. My goal is to augment and seal up those weaknesses / shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got my short term eyes set on a few companies and positions that I have heard great things about. I am excited at the possibility of learning even more by joining mathematics, free-thinking, machine learning and data expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here is to submit applications to DE Shaw LLC, DE Shaw Research, Google Brain Research Team, DeepMind, Facebook Research, Amazon Data Science, Amazon Health Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in order to make it within these groups, I should develop my fundamental computer science skills further by creating in C++ and Python the various data structures and Cracking the Code Interview problem sets. I should have a fundamental understanding of backpropagation, optimization, probability, statistics, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ review of data structures [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python review of data structures [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of backpropagation [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of machine learning basics [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Personal [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've picked up photography and I enjoy just posting on Instagram/Facebook, photos that I take, that I like. I've stopped dancing, but I've started working out on a consistent basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to reach a 
- bench of 225 [ ], 
- a deadlift of 275 [ ] and 
- consistent running of 1-5 miles (by the end of the year) [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Cooking and Lifestyle [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be cooking at least 5 times a week, so that I can maintain a healthy diet. I will look at maintaining a combination of recipes and learning something new every other month! I'll keep an update here on the recipes I learn and experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken Breast [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steak [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pasta With Meat [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salmon Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuna Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Fish Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(if possible): Other seafood [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Reading and Knowledge [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to continuously be reading from highly regarded sources. I want to conssistently read from sources on Twitter, The World Economic Review and Bloomberg. I'll try to update some of my thoughts on the different mechanisms of obtaining knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep up with my intake of knowledge, I want to challenge myself to write a series of publically available blog posts on trends in technology, medicine, politics and economics/finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin [X]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ethereum/blockchain [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;machine learning/AI [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foreign markets (EU/Asia) and cryptocurrency/blockchains [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emerging markets&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. London Airport (Stansted)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is on the north end of the city and you can take a train to get into the city, which will take about 40 minutes. However, there are always long security lines and a long passport control line. I suggest hustling out of your planes and also budgeting for travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total time would probably be 1.5 hours to/from the city center of London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. London Airport (Heathrow)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. London Airport (Gatwick)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is huge! Also has huge lines for security, so I would come early by at least 2 hours even if you're not checking in luggage. It takes awhile to get to some of the farther off gates. If you come early, they have some great airport lounges though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Notes:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UK has some weirdly strict rules on liquids that you can carry out from their airports. Like all EU countries, they require you to put liquids into a small plastic zip up, but they won't even let you bring in contact solution (in the big containers)! Most EU country airports will let you bring this on since it is a medical necessity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;!-- 1. Stonehenge day trip / Salisbury 
Southwest train from waterloo for 1.5 hrs
3. Oxford:
Oxford Univ.
Ashmolean Museum
Pitt Rivers Museum --&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. London Eye&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recommended to go and check out, but totally not worth going up. Beware of pick-pockets around this extremely crowded tourist area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Buckingham Palace / Big Ben&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-explanatory place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Millenium Bridge / Tower Bridge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great looking bridge that you can go up with ~10 pounds. Also recommended at night because it lights up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Cambridge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get there via Greater Anglia train for 1.5 hrs. Once there, you can go see:
- King's college chapel
- Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial
- Univ. of Cambridge (imo the coolest part because it is such a historical university)
- The River Cam&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Tate Museum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very cool modern art museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. National Gallery Museum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of good art ranging from portraits, impressionism and post-impressionism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp. London has a ridiculous amount of people, so if you have 3+ people, I would highly recommend trying to make reservations in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Lanzhou LaMian Noodle:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing handpulled noodle restaurant for any asian food cravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Burger and Lobster:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazing burger and lobster. Simplistic and reasonably priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chick N Sours:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great fried chicken place that is actually really healthy formulas for the fact that it is fried chicken!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Mr. Fogg's Residence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great speak-easy looking place! Serves some interesting drinks, but can get quite pricey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- #### 2. Ministry of Sound --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can definitely use the Underground, or just walk! UberX/Pool/Plus if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2017-12-20:/blog/2017/12/travel-london/</guid><category>travel</category><category>europe</category><category>UK</category><category>london</category></item><item><title>Using FreeSurfer</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2017/12/using-freesurfer/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Necessary Tools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freesurfer, FSL, and MRtrix3 are the three main neuroimaging and registration softwares that you need to run a systematic data pipeline of neuroimaging data (i.e. CT, MRI, DWI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Freesurfer
https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FreeSurfer is a software package for the analysis and visualization of structural and functional neuroimaging data from cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FSL
https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSL is a comprehensive library of analysis tools for FMRI, MRI and DTI brain imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MRtrix3 is primarily intended to be used for the analysis of diffusion MRI data. In addition, at its fundamental level it is designed as a general-purpose library for the analysis of any type of MRI data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Connectome Generation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freesurfer is a tool built for rendering 3D brains using MRI and Ct scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSL is a tool for coregistration and image analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download both online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Definitions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registration: to find a common coordinate system for the input data sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you will want to download freesurfer from the following website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall
Linux:
    ## bash
    $&amp;gt; export FREESURFER_HOME=/usr/local/freesurfer
    $&amp;gt; source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;## &lt;span class="nv"&gt;tcsh&lt;/span&gt;
$&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;setenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;FREESURFER_HOME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;usr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;freesurfer&lt;/span&gt;
$&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;source&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mh"&gt;$F&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;REESURFER_HOME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SetUpFreeSurfer&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span class="nv"&gt;csh&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mac:
    $&amp;gt; export FREESURFER_HOME=/Applications/freesurfer
    $&amp;gt; source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run those commands within your terminal, or add them to ~/.bashrc file to have access to all the command line tools for freeview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to setup your own directory where you will hold all your subject data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SUBJECTS_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;subject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will be where you store say patient's MRI/CT scans that you will use to reconstruct the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Running Through T1-Weighted MRI Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you want to set your current Subjects directory to where you are working with the raw say .dcm data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;SUBJECTS_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PWD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There may be an issue where you can't run the functions with your .dcm files. I have no idea why this occurs, but an easy fix is to externally run a dicom to nii converter and pass this type of file instead. Here is a link to a matlab converter that can do this:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42997-dicom-to-nifti-converter--nifti-tool-and-viewer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other resources online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, you can run the following command(s):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;recon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nii&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subject_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;autorecon1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;recon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nii&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subject_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will take a long time! So be prepared to run this on a compute engine that has time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Running Through CT Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flirt -in patient_ct.nii -ref patient_mri.nii -omat patient_omat.mat -out patient_registered.nii.gz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will coregister the CT data onto the domain of the MRI data and provide a coregistration for you to look at where certain contacts of electrodes are. You can also view in Freeview the different cuts of the brain using either CT, or MRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Getting Surface Parcellations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Getting SEEG XYZ Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have CT images coregistered with MRI images, you can easily extract the locations of all iEEG contacts in the MRI axis system. This is done by noting a contact within each electrode (e.g. A1, B1, C10, etc.) and then an algorithm can fill in the entire electrode's xyz coordinates and output to a file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D"&gt;https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sample Itinerary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYT-UxSW0CtTBlGOznBtBnpnF5huMIQmP7xUmOPhynE/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Charles' Optimized Itin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Budapest International Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, that this city doesn't have uber, so taxify or hailing a taxi is the way to go. The public transportation also works, but it requires some transfers, and honestly it's worth the money and the time to just take a taxi. Use the taixify link to download the app prior!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights/Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Szechenyi Baths&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a in &amp;amp; outdoor thermal spa, which is very picturesque and features a cool experience in varying bath temperatures. Totally worth coming no matter what time of year it is! Make sure you have enough money to either rent a towel (~$4), or bring your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. River Danube Tour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the Chicago architecture tour (which is awesome btw). However, I would highly recommend coming at nighttime. It gets a bit chilly, so if you have a blanket, bring that along in your backpack. Nighttime features the famous Hungarian Parliament building in all its golden glory. Make sure you get a good spot set up to take photos. In addition, most river tours give a free drink on board, so you can continue getting drinks and just get drunk while checking out the most beautiful night views in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Matthias Church / Buda Castle / Fisherman's Bastion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area in the Buda side is just so picturesque, you have to come here. You have a terrific view of the entire Budapest city and the architecture is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. St. Stephen's Basilisque&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a really nice looking church in the center of the city on the pest side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Hungarian Parliament Building&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just cause you saw this on the river danube tour, doesn't mean you shouldn't come see it again during the day! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. KonyvBar &amp;amp; Restaurant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book-themed restaurant that is totally worth booking a reservation for (else you probably can't get in). When I went, it was Harry Potter themed and I ordered a "Crystal ball". Fantastic meal and fantastic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Gelato Rosa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very nice looking gelato in the shape of flowers. Great for those instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Ruin Bars:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the famous bars that are within the "ruins" of Budapest, which came about from the various bombings during the world wars. It's really cool, but make sure you bring some cash to buy drinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Peaches &amp;amp; Cream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some night club that plays top 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, taxify/taxis are an affordable option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would recommend staying on the Pest side of Budapest because there is more night life and restaurants there. The buda side is a nice place to walk to for all the historical sites.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Lyon Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Basilisque Notre Dame Foire:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially another basilisque that is very beautiful and overlooks Lyon. It has an amazing view of the city. If you want nice lighting, I suggest coming in the middle to late afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is located on Fourviere Hill. Note that Google maps shows a circular route to take up the hill, but there is a staircase at the bottom that goes straight up. You just have to find it :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Vieux Lyon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic area of the city that is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Le Mur Des Canuts:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge mural on the side of a building in the northern part of Lyon. It is incredibly picturesque and it's very fun to just try different poses to fit into the mural!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Musée Des Beaux-arts de Lyon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest fine art museum after the Louvre in Paris. It is only 4 euros for a student, so it is highly recommended to go and check out some great art! There are some Monet pieces in here that are absolutely amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Parc de La Tete d’Or:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a super cool looking park, known as the Golden Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Slake:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic coffee cafe that serves some great breakfast foods, like quiche, sandwiches and cookies. Highly recommend as a start off to your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Yaafa:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially a vegetarian falafel shop that is extremely affordable and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend coming here if you're just sick and tired of French food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Bollywood Tandoor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an authentic Indian restaurant that also serves a buffet style portion. It's not bad and pretty affordable too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Lyonnaise Cuisine:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be in Lyon, then you absolutely have to try Lyonnaise cuisine once. Go on Tripadvisor and make a reservation for a heavily reviewed restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Wine Drinking On the Rhone:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the Rhone, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, Uber is plentiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the rivers Rhone and Saone towards the center of the city, else you'll spend an incredible amount of time walking/ubering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Prague International Airport | Vaclave Havel Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly recommended to get a taxi that for certain takes credit card. Most taxis will try to scam you and say their credit card machine stopped working. Ask before getting in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights/Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Kafe Damu&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 70 cent beers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Prague Castle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like Prague Art and Architecture you will go into St. Vitus, and probably into St. Georges Basilica and to Golden Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually one of the most beautiful castles I've been to and has some really nice architecture. There are also a lot of museums around the area worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. Castle Gardens (not open in Winter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. National Gallery in Prague&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Parizska Street and Old Town Square&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a really old town area that is nice to walk through and appreciate the Czech architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Piss Sculpture in New Town (English book store with Shakespeare)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a really funny looking sculpture there. It also has a famous museum for the writer: Franz Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Krizik Fountain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Charles Bridge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the infamous Charles Bridge. A lot of tourists and people taking wedding photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to also check out their river tours to get another point of view of this famous and historical bridge.

&lt;h4&gt;8. Prague Clock Tower&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really pretty looking clock tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Globe Cafe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great breakfast and lunch for american food. Has Wifi and a great place to study. Good colonel Panini and French onion soup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Bohemia Bagels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice bagels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lunch:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Kolkovna Celnice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snchnitzel is great with cornflake bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Fried Cheese Stands (at end of Wenceclas towards National Museum):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Sklep:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentic Czech food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Nase Maso&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is literally the best meat place you will ever find. It features some local butcher that also cooks some meat meals for you on the spot. There is always a line and they serve a really great cheeseburger, bone marrow, steak tartare and sausages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dinner:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Ristorante Grosetto Marina – on a boat by the river, so good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice restaurant and decently priced for being right on the river!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dessert:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. ANGELATO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gelato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;1. Hemminway Bar – authentic absinthe&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the coolest absinthe bar ever! It features loads of cool drinks that are hand made by the bartenders and has some really cool photos and history behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2. Prague Beer Museum&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 30 beers on tap and you can buy taste cups. Gets crowded on the weekends though, but beer lovers must go here. It's not actually a museum)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Must try beers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kout na Smunave &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staropramen (brewed in Prague)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pilsner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budweiser (the original)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Buses/Metro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are essentially 30 min, 90 min and full day passes that can be bought anywhere from 1-4 euros, which is incredibly affordable for a weekend in Prague!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of hidden pieces of art within the metro. You also get access to trams, which are great to go around the city center. The metro/tram and most buses only run until midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Walking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this city is very walkable with all the cool looking architecture and historical areas all around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
Public transportation is recommended for far places, and then walking is nice!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know your geography in Morocco. Since everything is easily accessible by train/night train, you can plan your trip by region and not spend too long in one city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 3 main airports that you can fly into from Europe and then get around to the rest of the country either by train, or by grand taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Casablanca Airport (CMN)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is located about an hour away from the city. You can grab an uber, or a taxi. However, I would look up prices ahead of time to make sure you can bargain a good deal into the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option might be to take the train into the city, which only runs once every hour and could be sketchier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Marrakesh Menara Airport (RAK)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is located well in the city and for locals it costs only about 30 MAD by bus, or 50 MAD by taxi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are getting a taxi as a tourist, honestly try not to pay over 100 MAD because then you're just getting ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Tangier Airport (TNG)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Casablanca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Hassan II Mosque&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big mosque that is next to the ocean. Not a bad place! Make sure you wear appropriate clothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Quartier Tabous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main souk of Casablanca. It's not that big compared to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jemaa El Fna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main souk / medina of Marrakech! This is where all the shops are that run for endless alleys. It is open all day and all night, so it is quite an experience to see the snake charmers during the day and all the shops come out in force at night when it cools down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ignore any of the locals with monkeys chained up. They steal monkeys from their home and mistreat them for tourists to take photos with them. If you really want to see a monkey in it's natural habitat, go to Ouzoud waterfalls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ouzoud Waterfall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tremendous sight 3 hours drive away from Marrakesh. You can book excursions here through tripadvisor, or viator. I only paid about 40 euros per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are wild monkeys here, Berber locals and an amazing waterfall. There are plenty of restaurants and local shops that you can buy souvenirs from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend asking your hotel/airbnb hosts about these things, or checking out tripadvisor. Morocco is not advanced like most US/EU cities, so you have to really explore and be comfortable trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Tangine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main Moroccan food. It essentially consists of some couscous and slow cooked meat and vegetables. It's great to try at least a few times! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Bazaar Cafe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rue Sidi El Yamani 24 Bis - Marrakech
www.bazaarcafe.ma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Roti D'or&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're sick and tired of eating tangine, then come here! This is a great kebab/falafel restaurant that is super cheap within the Jema El Fana in Marrakech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the local taxi system, or Uber. You generally want to establish the price of the taxi before getting in. "Combien" is the French word for "how much".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a taxi (and you don't have the japanese app), you can always ask the restaurant/bar/store you are at to order a taxi. They are always perfectly happy to call the taxis for you using their app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Probably taxi for within a city and trains/buses/grand taxis for across the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munich International Airport
Getting to the city from the airport is extremely easy. Just check google maps and you can take a direct S (1, or 8) train into the city. You can easily buy a ticket before reaching the station (within the airport) because it will definitely be crowded if it's tourist season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;0. Dachau Concentration Camp (!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important places to visit in Munich I think. You can google map and just take a short train ride over to this area. Then there is an easy to use bus, which you will need to use coins to buy a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Museum Brandhorst&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. St Peter's Church Tower / Marianplatz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the central location in old town and is a lively place with lots of small shops. It features a really old and pretty looking church. It is a short walk to Hofbrauhaus and Viktualienmarkt where you can get a lot of good street food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Eisbachwelle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a local gem. This area is where surfers come for a man-made river that is just off the side of the road under a bridge. You can come here and spend some time looking at surfers go on some crazy waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Hofgarten&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty garden area close to the local government building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Friedensengel (Angel of Peace)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historic monument dedicated to peace. Made out of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. English Garden (Monopterus)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD (closed during winter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. BMW Museum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW is headquartered in Munich and this museum features all the history and culture behind BMW. Very cool place to check out and also next door features all their luxury and next-generation cars on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Nymphenburg Palace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old palace that is worth walking around and checking out. The local huge pond features a bunch of swans always swimming around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Flaucher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Pasta e Basta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great pasta for a simple price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Steinhall 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great place for wiener-schnitzel and also currywurst!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Viktualienmarkt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great area for street food and local shopping for spices if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Haufbrohaus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A touristic beer hall that features 1 Liter beers and some traditional bavarian style food. It's a great place to go listen to live music, meet new people and get really really drunk. The beer is actually quite tasty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Burrito Company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're craving Mexican food while in Europe, this is the place to go. With a student ID, you can get a really authentic cheap burrito meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Augustiner Braustuben&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a less touristic beer hall, that features the local Augustiner beer. In my opinion it is a great beer and probably the best in Munich. Less crowded and boisterous then Haufbrohaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Oktoberfest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Christmas Markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink Christmas Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christkindlmarkt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas Market at the Chinese Tower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around would be the S line and the U, which goes throughout the entire city. It is pay by an honor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other then that, you can take an Uber or a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 05 Oct 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2017-10-05:/blog/2017/10/travel-munich/</guid><category>travel</category><category>europe</category><category>germany</category><category>munich</category></item><item><title>Important Concepts for Computational Modeling</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2017/09/fundamental-computational-modeling/</link><description>&lt;!-- MarkdownTOC --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational modeling involves setting up mathematical equations that represent some sort of statics, or dynamics within a system. You want to simulate these equations to understand behavior, fixed points, bifurcations and changes wrt parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Concepts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Numerical Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerical integration involves solving system of differential equations via numerical methods. This is in general split into deterministic vs stochastic differential equations. Here we will also split the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deterministic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Euler's Method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Runge-Kutta Method(s)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stochastic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heun methods seem to be more accurate, but more time consuming vs the Milstein method.
1) Heun Method
Simple discretization leading to Stratonovich integral. It is a "predictor-corrector method" because given value of X at time $t_n$, obtain predictors with Euler integration scheme, then correct it using Heun's correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details to be filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Milstein Method
Uses the derivative of the diffusion coefficients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Considerations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Convergence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;References:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comparison of stochastic integration https://arxiv.org/pdf/1102.4401.pdf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Deterministic and Stochastic Differential Equations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deterministic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example would be a population growth model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$dx_t = Kx_t dt,\ x(0)=x_0$, with K being some constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we have some inherent randomness, then maybe we can't assume $x_0$ is deterministic constant, but perhaps a random variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stochastic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example would be a population growth model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$dX_t(w) = KX_t(w) dt,\ X_0(w)$, with K being some constant and $X_t(w)$ is a random variable, which comes from the initial condition. K could also be random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$dX_t(w) = (Kdt + dW_t(w))X_t(w) dt,\ X_0(w)$, where $dW_t(w)$ is some noise process that adds randomness to K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the general SDE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$dX_t(w) = f_t(X_t(w))dt + \sigma_t(X_t(w))dW_t(w),\ X_0(w)$, where f is the deterministic drift of the SDE. $\sigma_t$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $dW_t(w)$ is the noise process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rewrite the SDE in integral form, which leads us to the Stratonovich integral and the Ito integral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$X_t(w) = X_0(w) + \int_t_0 f_s(X_s(w)) ds + \int_t_0 \sigma_s(X_s(w)) dW_s(w)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ito integral =&amp;gt;
Stratonovich integral =&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2017-09-27:/blog/2017/09/fundamental-computational-modeling/</guid><category>phd</category><category>journals</category><category>reviews</category><category>computational modeling</category></item><item><title>Simulating Epileptic iEEG Activity Using The Virtual Brain</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2017/09/simulating-tvb/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TVB is a platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics that starts from raw data involving:
    1. structural connectivity derived from DTI
    2. brain parcellation derived from MRI and CT
    3. SEEG xyz locations derived from MRI and CT
This will then determine a gain matrix to determine SEEG signals from the source signals that are generated from neural mass models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural mass models will be implemented with nonlinear, complex models for simulating certain type of electrophysiology. The Epileptor is used for simulating seizure activity from a specific source region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epileptor is a set of coupled differential equations that rely on 6 different variables. They are described here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data &amp;amp; Metadata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, refer to my post on "Freesurfer" to establish the preprocessing data pipeline using Freesurfer, FSL and MRtrix3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum necessary requirements for creating the TVB dataset are a set of T1 and DWI images as a list of dicom files, or a single 4-D image nifti file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high level summary of how the pipeline proceeds is:
1. Construct Cortical Surface, Subcortical Surface
Using freesurfer, you can get the reconstructed surfaces, which are your files that outline the voxels that belong to each region of the brain. This will give you the surface geometries of the cortical and subcortical surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construct Parcellation Scheme
This can range from the default in freesurfer to different atlases available for the human brain. This will give you a region mapping for every vertex/face from your cortical/subcortical surface geometries files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construct Corticography Tracts
First, you need to coregister the DWI images with the T1 scans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the DWI images, along with the reconstructed surfaces, you can count fiber tracts between each region of the brain and reconstruct the structural connectivity matrices. This is composed from the weights matrix and the length matrix between parcellated regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtain Electrode Coordinates in T1 Space
First, you need to coregister the CT reconstructed freesurfer file into the T1 space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computing Gain Matrix Between Brain Regions and Electrodes
In order to compute forward solutions of electrode (i.e. SEEG, ECoG, etc.) activity, you need to compute a gain matrix that transforms region activity into electrode activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be done using an inverse-square method fall-off on the region activity, or using a dipole method as outlined in the "Virtual Epileptic Patient" paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Setting Up Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you may want to set up a conda environment, or a virtualenv that will separate the entire python project from your normal OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nibabel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;networkx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tvb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;https&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;virtual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;brain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tvb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a script to add these all to path for your jupyter notebook, use the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Launching IPython Notebook from TVB Distribution&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -z &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LANG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;LANG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;en_US.UTF-8
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;LC_ALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LANG&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# add tvb data and library to path and launch notebook&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/_tvbdata:&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/_tvblibrary:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Simulating Epilepsy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to simulate epilepsy, you are going to walk through a pipeline using TVB. Details are left out for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. Structural Connectivity
What is the matrix of connectivities between your brain regions?
Ex: Connectivity weights, conduction speed, coupling function between long-range regions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. Neural Mass Model
What is the phenomenological model at brain regions?
Ex: Epileptor6D, with parameter settings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iii. Integrators
How to solve your stochastic differential equation?
Ex: Heunstochastic, with noise levels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iv. Coupling
How are your brain regions coupled?
Ex: linear, additive, hyperbolic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v. Monitors
What variables to monitor and store?
Ex: State variables, iEEG activity from sampling rate and period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then once these are complete, you can run your simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary / Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us define X as input signal, and Y as desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, they were interested in deriving a quantitative method for optimizing 1) compression rate of a signal and 2) the choice of representation of the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous theory looked at minimizing the rate of compression given a constraint on expected distortion of the original signal (with new compression). This was solved via iterative algorithm (similar to EM), but lacked generality to find optimal representatives, which minimize the expected distortion (not just compression) of the signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theory looks at minimizing the rate of compression given a constraint on the amount of information we can keep about Y using X. This produces an iterative algorithm that also can be solved iteratively. It also shows that 1) the Kullback-Leibler divergence is the relevant distortion measure for the information bottleneck setting, and 2) optimization of representation of signal and the signal compression can be done together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work can be used in applications to information processing problems (e.g. deep learning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual information is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$I(X;Y) = D_{KL}[P(x,y)||P(x)P(y)] = \sum_{x\in X, y\in Y} P(x,y) log(\frac_{P(x,y)}&lt;em X_="X," Y x_in="x\in" y_in="y\in"&gt;{P(x)P(y)})$
$= \sum&lt;/em&gt;P(x,y) log(\frac_{P(x|y)}_{P(x)}) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, where $D_{KL}(p||q)$ is the Kullback-Liebler divergence of distributions p and q, and $H(X)$ and $H(X|Y)$ are entropy and conditional entropies, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the optimal representations of signal X with respect to output label Y. Sufficient statistics are maps/partitions of X, S(X) that captures all the information X has about Y. The mutual information given Y is equal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$I(S(X); Y) = I(X; Y)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can allow the map to be stochastic, with encoder P(T|X) and allow map to capture as much as possible of I(X;Y), not necessarily all of it $I(S(X); Y) \leq I(X; Y)$. Define $t \in T$ as compressed representations of $x \in X$, stochastically, $p(t|x)$. The following optimization problem finds a balance between compression of X and prediction of Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$min_{p(t|x),p(y|t),p(t)}\ {I(X;T) - \beta I(T;Y)}$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks Via Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00810.pdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary / Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the authors extend their analysis of DNN using information theory. They answered the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SGD layer dynamics in the Information plane.
First the layers increase $I(T_i;Y)$, and then later decrease $I(X; T_i)$, which corresponds to increasing the information about Y and then later compressing the representation (empirical error minimization &amp;amp; representation compression phase).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effect of the training sample size on the layers.
It seems that sample size does not have an effect on empirical error minimization, but does have an effect on the representation compression. Smaller sample sizes has overfitting, which has been seen as overfitting the sample noise. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the benefit of the hidden layers?
Adding hidden layers reduces the number of training epochs. It also seems to accelerate compression, but adding extra width does not seem to help. With layered diffusion of the SGD optimization (backpropagation), it seems that there is an exponential decrease in epochs with K hidden layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the final location of the hidden layers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the hidden layers form optimal IB representations?
It seems that the hidden layers converge to the optiaml IB representations. However, we can see that there can be clearly many different layers that correspond to the same IB representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important hypothesis/conjecture they make is that: attempts to interpret single weights, or even single neurons in such networks can be meaningless because there is a large number of different networks that can achieve optimal performance. This makes sense in terms of how the brain is structured; the brain does not form the same pathway for learning something new between different people, but form a unique network for optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they estimated the mutual information of the layers with the input and with the labels $I(X;T_i)$ and $I(T_i;Y)$. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need airbnb (you'll get a free $40 off):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH"&gt;https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Marseille Provence Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main airport for Marseille and it is located about 30 minutes north of the city. For transportation, you really only have two options: taxi/uber, or taking the bus. The bus is actually very convenient and runs every ~15-20 minutes and goes to Aix en Provence and also Marseille St Charles Station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are 25 y/o or younger, it only costs 6 euros, but for everyone else it is 8 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge castle/basilisque that stands at the top of a hill overlooking Marseille. You can take the bus here, but I've only ever walked. It is an amazing sight to look over the city during sunset, or at night time. However, any other time is also great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Les Calanques (Best Thing!)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hiking trail and place to go to check out a sick view. This is highly recommended because all you need to do is take a bus to Luminy and then you can walk 30 minutes to an amazing vantage point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple calanques in this area; the main ones total 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are accessible by a boat that leaves from Vieux Port, Marseille, or the port of Cassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the port of Cassis from Marseille, you have to take a train, or a bus. The train from Saint Charles will leave you about 2-3 km inland, so it is not ideal. However, there is a M8 bus that leaves from Castellane metro station that will get you directly to the port of Cassis. This bus is very infrequent and the time tables are not on Google maps. You need to google "How to get to Cassis from Marseille with M8 bus" to find the timetables that are most current. At the time that I went, I don't think the bus ran on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the calanques via boat is easy. You just go to Vieux Port, or in Port Miou and buy a ticket for the next ferry ride. I highly recommend doing all 9 calanques to get the full experience. The sad thing is that there is no direct ferry from Port Miou to Vieux Port, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Cathedral La Major&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a very pretty looking cathedral that stands next to the water. It is a beautiful place to watch the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Vieux Port&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A docking port that has a lot of tourists and boats. Nice place to walk around. Feel free to come here for trips to Les Calanques, or Chateau d'lf and Frioul Archipelago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Musee des Civilisations d'Europe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really cool looking museum. This actually lights up at night and just has a really cool architecture. It is also free on the first Sunday of every month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Parc Longchamp&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Chateau d'lf&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An island fortress and former prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Frioul Archipelago&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An island 8 km off the coast of Marseille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. House of Raviolis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to Marseille looking for French food, but you're tired of sandwiches and baguettes, look no further! As a Californian, I have to say this place is definitely above average in terms of chinese food. It's moderately priced and serves some great dumplings and egg noodles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Le Maison Geney&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Noodles Chop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the mood for some good pickme up Vietnamese food, come here! It's only open at lunchtime on weekdays, but it serves some very affordable Vietnamese sandwiches, noodles and soups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Sur Le Pouce&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marseille is pretty close to Morocco and there are many immigrants here. So this place is a great bang for your $ because they serve you huge portions! It is great to try out some traditional Moroccan tangine and some meat skewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Tapas Rojas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Tako-san&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the train/metro. If you are here for the weekend, or more, I would suggest getting the 10 ride pass. It is perfectly affordable, but if you're running late, you can easily get a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other then that, feel free to walk in most areas in the south part of the city, or just call an uber!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near Vieux Port, Joliette, or the southern part of the city.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Examples of different types of neurons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thalamic cells, pyramidal cells, double pyramidal cells, granule cells, purkinje cells. These all have different morphologies and perform different computations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stochastic State-Space Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, list the linear, time-invariant system with a state evolution equation and measurement/observation equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state and observation noises are independent, zero-mean Gaussian white processes with some defined covariances&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Expectation Maximization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By computing the likelihood of your unknown parameters, based on known outcomes. You can perform maximum likelihood estimation to get the best estimate of the unknown parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. K-Means Algorithm&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost function is attempting to minimize the distortion (distance to centers) for every point in the set of data points, S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''
Input: k clusters
initialize centers: z_1, ..., z_k \in \real^d and clusters C_1, ..., C_k
repeat until there is no further change in L(z, C):
    for each j (data point): C_j &amp;lt;- {x \in S whose closest center is z_j}
    for each j (data point): z_j &amp;lt;- mean(C_j) 
'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk through for a small example to see how the algorithm works:
(0, 0, 0)
(0, 0.5, 1)
(1, 3, 2)
(4, 5, 6)
(2, 3, 1)
(5, 2, 0)
(0, 1, 0)
(1, 1, 0)
(2, 1, 0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initialization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialization of a k-means type algorithm initializes k "means", we call centers at the beginning, and then assigns points into these centers based on the cost function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Convergence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Show that the cost monotonically decreases, so the algorithm will converge at least in the sense of cost decreasing to a non-changing amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;6. Sensory Pathways and Systems in Neuroscience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different neuronal pathways in the central nervous system, vs the periphery nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual sensory pathway that leads from the retina all the way to the occipital lobe of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The somatosensory pathways that lead to the SI, and SII all with nerve sensors from the periphery of your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;7. Motor Pathways and Systems in Neuroscience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does motor movements get controlled in the brain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premotor cortex, and also the motor cortex are at the highest levels of control. We can also include the cerebellum when we talk about motor control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;8. General Topics in Neuroscience&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good things to know and remember are:
- Hodgkin Huxley models: a biophysical model that models realistic neuronal firing based on concentration gradients, membrane conductances, membrane potentials and even more.
- Nernst equation: a fundamental equation for determining the resting potential of a membrane in the presence of a concentration gradient of an ion.
- Goldman-Katz equation: a model with multiple ions that determins the resting potential of a membrane (extension of Nernst)
- Action potentials and the chronology of cell actions that are taken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;9. Gaussian Mixture Models&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the idea that some data distributions can be the combinations of many different Gaussian models with different means and variance, but superimposed on each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of a gaussian mixture model is to identify the parameters of each of the separate gaussians by a process called Expectation Maximization. In this process, we switch between maximizing the likelihood by iterating on the parameters of the gaussian models and computing a new likelihood function given the new parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How long should I study for?
A: I would study for about 2-3 weeks with nothing else going on. You want to be able to do a comprehensive overview of everything first, and then dive deeper into topics that are more likely to come up. You should also do test runs of walking through "open-ended" questions on a white board many times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to practice thinking out loud and being very clear in your communication.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2017 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2017-08-05:/blog/2017/08/doctoral-board-oral/</guid><category>doctoral board oral</category><category>phd</category><category>johns hopkins</category></item><item><title>Travel - Baltimore</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2017/08/travel-baltimore/</link><description>&lt;h1&gt;Baltimore, MD&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Peabody Library:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main library of the peabody institute (music school and concert hall). It's very beautiful and free to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Inner Harbor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the harbor of Baltimore and where a lot of ships are docked. Around here you can check out various ships for a small entrance fee of ~$10-20. It also has a lot of shops around the area, a Shake Shack, a huge Barnes &amp;amp; Noble (which was built inside a battery factory) and a lot of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. National Aquarium:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the NATIONAL aquarium and costs about $40 normally to get into. However, if you come at night time starting at around 4PM, you can get in for half price. It's worth checking out because it's very big and national for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Fort Mchenry:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fort where the Star Spangled Banner was born. It has a lot of American history and costs about $10 to go through. You can reach this location by car, or you can even take a water ferry from the Inner Harbor for a nice ride in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Miss Shirley's Cafe:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very famous and exquisite breakfast/brunch cafe in the general Virginia/Maryland area. They have amazing drinks (I highly suggest going for a boozy brunch) and also amazing fried chicken &amp;amp; waffles. Also, you should try the french toast, fried green tomatoes and monkey bread. A must if you visit Baltimore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Woodberry Kitchen:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the best restaurants in Baltimore. It is slightly on the more expensive side, but it is still affordable for a one time meal. Everything is incredibly rustic and feels like it came out of a cabin home kitchen. The atmosphere is very homey and can be a good meal for a couple, or even a medium sized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chocolate Over Water:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small restaurant great for brunch, lunch or even dinner! It is BYOB, so you can even bring your own wine bottle. The menu is great and I would follow Yelp. You can't really go wrong with portion size and dollars spent here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Abbey's Burger House:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're into crazy exotic burgers, this is the place to be. They have meat ranging from deer, to ox, to regular beef. Burgers are pretty good and it's nice to have a beer while watching sports. Go Lakers/Warriors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. LP Steamers:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland is known for their crab and this is definitely the place to get it! This is a multiple story restaurant, where you will definitely need to wait an hour or two to get in (if you have a large group). You can order crabs and crack them open with your own wooden hammer. It is definitely a must-try experience for all Maryland first-timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Fell's Point:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bars ranging from the Horse You Came In On, to Bond Street. Honestly, if you're into dive bars, come check it out. If you're into partying/clubbing, not the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Federal Hill (Fed Hill):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many bars, so you can easily bar hop! Beware, there are a lot of college (wannabe frat stars) kids here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Mt. Vernon / Charles Village:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More classy and upscale bars. I would recommend checking out WC Harlan, which is a speakeasy located in south part of Charles Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber/Lyft are incredibly cheap within this city. I would use this solely because the subway system is not that great and the bus system isn't ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the circulators are generally free if you are just looking to get a free ride from Hopkins -&amp;gt; Inner Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? 
A: I would try to stay at Inner Harbor, Fed Hill, or Canton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Baltimore, where should I go?
A: Miss Shirley's, Woodberry Kitchen, and Chocolate Over Water to eat. Inner Harbor and the National Aquarium to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things to be added:
1. sample itinerary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've added to different sights, whether it is good for indoors (when weather is poor)! Look for the $\bold{[X]}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to/from the airport, you can take the metro, which is only about $3. Else, you can take uber/lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Hare Airport: &lt;br /&gt;
This is the main airport that is a lot larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway Airport: &lt;br /&gt;
This is the main airport that services Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the home of the infamous Chicago Bean. The entire area has very cool architecture, and there is a snake bridge that goes over the highway that leads to a park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend coming to check out the Bean once during the day and once in the late afternoon. The different lights provide for a truly appreciative experience. If you're into checking out cool parks, go to the playground that is across the snake bridge. There's an incredible playground built for kids, but it's a great experience to relive your childhood making your way through the slides, tree houses and swings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Art Institute of Chicago: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would highly recommend if you're into art. A great collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chicago Architecture River Tour: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is advertised all over the city. A ticket costs ~$35 and you go on a large boat that will take you on a guided tour throughout the river and talk about some of the history of Chicago and its beautiful architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the price seems hefty, it's a great thing to try at least once (hell, I've gone twice and loved it both times). I would definitely recommend trying this in the warmer seasons because it can get unbearably cold outside on the boat deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Willis Tower / Sears Tower:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was at one point the tallest building in the USA and houses the infamous glass cube. You've probably seen a bunch of your friends Instagram this. If you're afraid of heights, it might not be the best idea. However, it definitely makes for a cool sight and is worth the trip at least once. 
It does cost quite a bit of money to go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Lincoln Park Zoo: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is free, so why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Crown Fountain: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to Cloud Gate, you just have to venture a bit south to reach this beautiful sight. It's essentially a huge fountain that is great to take photos of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Navy Pier: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pier that you can walk around, which houses a ferris wheel and a bunch of other amusement park rides. It's a great walk during the warmer seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. River Walk: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incredible area is essentially a walkway along the river of Chicago. It takes you from the Trump Tower all the way down the river, and is an incredible place to walk during the daytime as well as night time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note, that there is a closing time for the river walk at night (~11PM), so I would go around 9 if you want to grab some great night shots of Chicago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Deep Dish Pizza: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has heard about the infamous Chicago deep dish pizza. Well if you're into pizza, meat, cheese and sauce, then it's really worth the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The places that are well worth the try are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lou Malnati's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giordano's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pizzeria Uno &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to decide which one is the best, but for my personal preference I like them in this order because Lou generally has a better crust. It's more crunchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Garrett's Popcorn: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a famous popcorn place that sells all different kinds of popcorn. You name it; they probably have it. Everything from caramel, chocolate covered, to regular popcorn, Garrett's has it all. This is great for souvenirs for friends/family/coworkers because they sell them either in traditional popcorn bags, or in to-go containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Purple Pig: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in all of USA. It's a tapas place (family style sharing of small plates), so definitely try to come with a group. There is generally a wait, so I would recommend putting your name down early around dinner opening, or lunch opening, and then possibly going and walking along the RiverWalk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on what to eat because truly everything there is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Girl on the Goat: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also by far one of my most favorite restaurants in all of USA. It's a tapas place (family style sharing of small plates), so definitely try to come with a group. It's slightly more upscale and more expensive then the Purple Pig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would advise MAKING A RESERVATION well before your trip. If you have a large group, there is no way you will get seated if you are only in town for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on what to eat because truly everything there is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Wildberry Cafe: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite brunch place. It's right next to Cloud Gate / Millenium Park. Hands down, make sure you try their specialty pancakes and pretty much everything else on the menu is great. There will always be a wait, so you can put your name down and then go check out Millenium Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. The Mid: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a night club that houses some DJs from time to time (e.g. I saw Dash Berlin here once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Sound Bar: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a night club that houses some DJs from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Three Dots and a Dash: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a speakeasy that has very instagram/snapchat worthy drinks. It's worth checking out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Signature Room: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not willing to pay to go up to Willis Tower, you can come here to grab a drink and get a free view of Chicago. It's great to see both during the day and at night because of Chicago's night lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. JPark Rooftop Bar: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rooftop bar that is just a great place to chill and relax. You can place reservations if you have a large group, so make sure to do that, else it can get crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Goose Island Brewery: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard it's good. I'll have to check it out and leave my comments here sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the advent of Uber/Lyft, you could definitely get around by just walking and taking the subway. There is a 'blue line' that is open 24/7, which is AMAZING. Chicago sells 3 day all-you-can-ride tickets for $20, but to be honest with Uber/Lyft, you can easily get around and save a lot more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to/from the airports, you can easily take the subway lines to wherever you're staying. I would recommend this over Uber/Lyft because it's only a few dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you're downtown, generally you can walk everywhere. So I would advise just using the subway to/from the airport and then Uber/Lyft with your group elsewhere. Obviously if you're solo traveling, I would probably get a multi-day subway pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? &lt;br/&gt;
A: Generally, I'm an advocate of staying downtown because then everything is walking distance. If not, I would try to stay within walking distance to a subway station. Stay away from South Chicago because that is a very crime-ridden area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Chicago, where should I go? &lt;br/&gt;
A: Purple pig, Girl on the goat, Lou Malnati's to eat. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park and the River Walk to see. Signature Room for a night time drink if you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a blog post assuming you'll be spending a bit of time around the entirety of Japan (e.g. few days in a few cities). Know your geography in Japan. Since everything is easily accessible by high speed train, you can plan your trip by region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tokyo:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Narita airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main international airport near Tokyo. To get to and from here, you can take the Narita express for ~30,000 yen ($30 USD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Haneda airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the domestic airport near Tokyo. You can get between the airports for ~$15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Osaka&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Kansai airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main airport near Osaka. It is easy to get to and from here using the metro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cultural Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese people have an incredible sense of respect, which is engrained into their culture. Don't take this to mean that they are pushovers, but simply be grateful and observant of this. For example, I felt like a super rude American when I was rushing to get to the escalator, when I realized everyone filed in single-file line!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tokyo:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Shibuya Walkway&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the famous walkway that you see in Fast and Furious and a bunch of time-lapse videos. I like going to one of the surrounding shops and watching from the window. It's pretty cool and then maybe going into the crowd to walk where as many as 2500 people cross every signal change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. TV Tower&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great view (night, or day) of the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Mount Fuji (day trip)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount Fuji is actually very doable in the summer time! You can take public transport a significant portion up the mountain and then climb the rest of the way. There is also an option of hiking up with a tour guide and then seeing the sunrise (haven't done this, but will TBD).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Osaka:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Osaka Castle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really nice looking castle with a lot of history in the multi-level museum inside. There are also a bunch of street acts always around, including animal trainers (I caught a great photo of an owl once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Dotonburi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really famous area that shows an entire street of Japanese lanterns. It's really beautiful at night time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Kyoto:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably one of my favorite cities because of how beautiful and culturally different it is. I would even recommend getting a bike and going around the city that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Kiyomizu-dera Shrine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous water temple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Kinkaku-ji&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous temple that is golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Arashiyama Forest&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really sick forest that houses local monkeys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Fushima Inari-Taisha&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really incredible temple/area/shrine that has incredible history and culture behind it. Also home of local monkeys!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nara:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Nara Park&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous area where you can feed the local deer! They smell by the way. The best time to go is definitely in the morning before they're super full from the loads of tourists overfeeding them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy bread/lettuce beforehand, or you end up getting ripped off by the local carts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, tripadvisor, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Gen Sushi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great turnstyle sushi place that I've been probably 3-5 times everytime I've been in Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Ichiran Ramen&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great ramen shop that you order from a vending machine and sit in a "cubicle" like area to eat. Absolutely... great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Omakase (Find a sushi restaurant with good reviews)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a style of sushi where essentially the chef picks what to serve you. Kind of pricey, but absolutely delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Roppongi&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratchet area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Shibuya (Izakaya)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a Japanese way of eating and drinking over a meal. It's basically a very cool pregame and a good way of socializing and getting drunk. Order a lot of beer and get some japanese finger food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the subway system. Getting between cities is extremely easy with the Japanese high speed train system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a taxi (and you don't have the japanese app), you can always ask the restaurant/bar/store you are at to order a taxi. They are always perfectly happy to call the taxis for you using their app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: I highly suggest getting the Kansai pass ahead of time if you are going to be traveling in that region. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Namsan Tower&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's where all the couples put their locks on a fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Gwanghwamun Palace and Gyeongbukgong Palace&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're into historical stuff, these are some old temples you can check out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Bukchon Village&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small traditional village with cute boutiques and restaurants that you can walk around if you want to get away from the super modern shopping areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Cheonggyecheon Stream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stream is all lit up at night so it's very nice to stroll around there at night/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Namdaemun Market&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Super cheap street market where you can get souvenirs, bags, clothes, etc. Kind of random but if you wear glasses they are also well known for having cheap glasses! I got a new pair of frames+lens for like $60 and they made it for me within an hour or so!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Dragon Hill Spa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you want to have the spa experience that you always see in kdramas, this is one of the largest spas in Korea (I think there are like 7 stories) and I remember they can speak Chinese/English so it wasn't too hard to communicate. Also they sell fried chicken on one of the floors and its really good!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are metro stations, but be wary of when they close. Uber is also (as of 2017) only Uberblack, so make sure to do some research and download the local Korean taxi app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Conda/Pip Install&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting your virtualenv setup, run 'pip install pelican'. Also include additional packages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;beautifulsoup4&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;typogrify&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Pillow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;webassets&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;conda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;website&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;conda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;conda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;forge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;conda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;damianavila82&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;piexif&lt;/span&gt; # &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;pyexif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;conda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;conda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;forge&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;ghp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;for helping to write in Markdown and writing pretty text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Start up pelican:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you will need to create a separate branch that you work on. This branch contains your actual markdown files, which are rendered and then copied OVER to your master branch during the Publishing section. This then renders html using git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;checkout&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;source_branch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;pelican&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;quickstart&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;then go through the directions and create your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Installing common pelican-themes and pelican-plugins:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--recursive https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--recursive https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Choosing Your Hosting Server&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of options, but you should decide how you want to host your site because then it will be built into your pelican project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github Pages: This is the free and most convenient way to do things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S3 by Amazon: Costs money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku, PythonAnywhere, and More: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installing and Choosing Themes/Plugins&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to install the pelican themes and the pelican plugins, if you want to use the open source themes and plugins developed. Then you can add code to your python files to add certain plugins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PLUGIN_PATHS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;path/to/pelican-plugins&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PLUGINS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;assets&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;sitemap&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;gravatar&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;JINJA_ENVIRONMENT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;extensions&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;jinja2.ext.i18n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Pushing Content to Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Via Fab (Old)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'pip install ghp-import fabric'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using ghp-import:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First run install by 'pip install ghp-import'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can run code like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ghp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;commit message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using fab:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install fabric by running 'pip install fabric'. Then insert code into your fabfile.py:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;publishghp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;preview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#builds publishconf.py&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;git add -A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#will commit allll files, be careful&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;git commit -m &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ghp-import -m &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;#39; -b master output&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;git push --all&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and then run &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ fab publishghp:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;commit message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to create commits up to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Via Git Directly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First just push all your stuff to your path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;commit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;first commit&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;--all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;make&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;github&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Adding Pages of Static Content&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you want to add a homepage, about me page and other static pages that are relevant to your site. Create a directory inside /content/pages/ to hold your static pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Adding Articles To Your Blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add articles to your blog, create /content/blog/ directory and create subdirectories in there. For example, I have academic, coding, and travel as my subdirectories in my blog. Then adjust your pelicanconf.py file for these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VirtualEnv: 15.1.0
VirtualEnvWrapper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual environment is useful for development in Python because it keeps your packages for certain projects separate from each other. It'll keep everything for that project separated in a separate wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For virtualenvironment, follow https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For virtualenvwrapper, follow http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Basics (Create, Delete):&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Create&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenvwrapper: Run the command &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;mkvirtualenv &amp;lt;envname&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenv: Run command &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;./venv/&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;inside your project directory. or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mkvirtualenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to make the virtual environment with a specific python installation (e.g. 2.7, or 3.4). With python3.6 and most of the recent versions, the virtualenvironment is built in, so you can just run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;name_of_venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;which is great because it handles it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Delete a Virtualenv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenvwrappper: In order to delete a virtual environment, all you need to do is to remove it recursively from your ~/.virtualenvs directory with    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;sudo rm -rf &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenv: Go to the directory of your project and delete the /venv/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Starting up your Venv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup your virtual environment by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;workon&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;name_of_virtualenvironment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. Requirements.txt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a convenient file for you to make that keeps track of all your packages. If you ever want to run your project on a new computer, you just create a new virtual environment and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To create the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pip&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;freeze&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Convenient Tools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Automatically cd To Project Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input the following code to your ./virtualenvs/postactivate file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;subtract&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;project&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;get_project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; {
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;venv_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="nv"&gt;VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_HOOK_DIR&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="nv"&gt;VIRTUAL_ENV&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt;#&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;$venv_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;}   # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;difference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;between&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;two&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;strings&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_project_name&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;}     # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;leading&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;character&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class="nv"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="nv"&gt;project_name&lt;/span&gt;
        ## &lt;span class="nv"&gt;uncomment&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;debugging&lt;/span&gt;
        # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="nv"&gt;venv_dir&lt;/span&gt;
        # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="nv"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt;
        # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="nv"&gt;temp_project_name&lt;/span&gt;
        # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; $&lt;span class="nv"&gt;project_name&lt;/span&gt;
    }

    # &lt;span class="nv"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;proj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;cd ~/Documents/$(get_project_name)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;root_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/Users/adam2392/Documents/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;project_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;$&lt;span class="ss"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;get_project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;root_dir&lt;/span&gt;}&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;${&lt;span class="nv"&gt;project_dir&lt;/span&gt;}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Make sure you change 'root_dir' to the correct root directory of your projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumes that your project directory files are all correspondingly named with your virtualenv. This is convenient for changing directory into your project directory automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Charles De Gaulle Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main international airport of France! If you're coming here, you can take an RER train into the city for ~10 euros, so if you have 3, or 4 people, honestly I think Ubering into the city is not a bad option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Orly Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other airport that is on the other side of the city, on the south end. If you need to travel between airports, there is a shuttle that runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Eiffel Tower&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iconic Eiffel tower. I liked taking a walk around the entire area, and my favorite spot is definitely from the Palaid de Chaillot, and the Jardins du Trocadero. My favorite time is probably during sunset, when the Eiffel tower looks golden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Champs De Lysee (I think that's how it's spelled)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An iconic boulevard that leads from the Arc de Triomphe to this Ferris Wheel. It's a bunch of shops and just a very nice walkway. At night time, it looks amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Sacre-Coeur&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big chapel in Europe! But this is nice to get a city view of the entire Paris. It's also a nice area to just bring a few baguettes and bottles of wine to come chill at the steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Louvre&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famous museum. Two entrances that are either through the big iconic pyramid, or through the metro stop. Usually... the metro entrance has less of a line, but it's still pretty long (although waiting in doors is way nicer!). Would recommend getting there early, or going on an off day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Les Catacombes de Paris&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Arc de Triomphe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iconic. Probaby not worth going up in my opinion, but you can come here and then walk down Champs De Lysee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also... very famous and worth going once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Robert et Louis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sick steak place. Very old and nice interior that is super French.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. La Duree&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive macarons that are... extremely worth it. Also great pastries!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Wine Drinking On the Seine/Near Eiffel Tower:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the Seine, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This city can get pretty big, but most of the famous iconic spots are north of the Seine, so you could technically walk it, but I would definitely recommend getting a packet of metro tickets (they sell up to 10 at a time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the Seine river if possible! Preferably on the north side because it's nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I took some time around 1 year ago to plan out ten things I wanted to carry out in 2016. I've enjoyed it a lot because it's been a goal to work towards for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I want to look at what I set out to do, and where I've come in regards to those goals. It will be interesting to see how my own priorities simply a year ago changed throughout the year and what I want to keep and discard for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2016 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitely did it with Vegas trips, Coachella, Asia traveling, San Francisco, Chicago and New York City. All were done with great friends that I would take a bullet for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Read more about politics and current events in our country. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I think this year was a turmoil in the United States with Donald Trump having been elected. Personally, I was spurred to follow and read more news through Twitter, Facebook and news journal sites. Although I have yet to become an expert, it has definitely exposed me to thought leaders ranging from Democratic/Republican leaders to news journalists to high ranking company executives. I've begun formulating my own thoughts on the topic (which I won't go into) and I think it's really helped me think about what I want for my future, my family's future, my children's future and my country's future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Start choreographing again. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Totally did not do this. Will have to put this on a higher priority list this year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Enter in 1-2 jams. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hurt my ankle during the time frame when I could've definitely entered the jam at Johns Hopkins. I'm pretty disappointed though that I didn't try to do more while it was summer time and I was still relatively free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I definitely had a late start this year by only doing this towards the end of 2016, but I'm definitely getting more into it. I've learned the basics of manipulating aperture, shutter speed and angles. It's really fun and I'm surprised by how excited I get over good photos and photo opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think logging experiences in graduate school are important, but more important are reaching those milestones. I've realized how tough different aspects of the PhD are and I think for 2017 I would want to focus more effort on tangibly meeting milestones in graduate school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp;amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got lazy and then my ankle got hurt, but I definitely want to try again for 2017!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Spend less time on myself and volunteer more. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I don't think I've done this at all, but in a different interpretation I've focused more on making an impact outside of research. I'm very excited to say that I started HEME (Hopkins Engineering Medicine Exchange) with one of my close friends in graduate school and I have big dreams for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9. Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat). [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't do a great job towards the beginning because I think as all millennials are, I was addicted to seeing how other people's lives were progressing. However, simply today, one of my good friends showed me a video I think is worth sharing. (https://www.facebook.com/deltaprotective/videos/10157890106040640/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED) I want to spend even less time by keeping "Kill News Feed" and using Instagram/Facebook simply to log photographs I take and memories I want to engrave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Be content with paying my dues. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this year I started to examine what excites me in life and what excites me about the future. It definitely isn't working at some corporate 9-5 job (even if I think the job is "impactful"). It's innovating and pushing the bounds of medicine using engineering, mathematics and computer programming. These topics are what excite me, while medicine is what spurs me to make a difference. I'm looking forward to spending ~5 (hopefully) years at Johns Hopkins absorbing different learning experiences and getting my Masters in Applied Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics while I'm also there. Why not get a free additional education with the PhD while I'm there?
6/10 kinda. I guess not bad :p.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New 2017 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I might not be able to choreograph a piece, participate in jams and get involved in dance photography, I want to simply keep bboying, keep taking choreo classes and keep my camera/gopro at all major dance events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to start running couple miles at the gym every other day and hopefully do one in the spring :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Read four new books: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, I've managed to read ~4 books due to a book club established with my friends and I. It's made me more engaged in my own self development because I spent less time on social media and video games before sleeping. I want to do it again with or without another book club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been exercising at the gym more this year and I'm pretty happy with where I've gotten. I think being able to deadlift 245 and bench 225 are solid goals to have for this year. While continuing dancing, I hope to live a healthier lifestyle. In addition, this could entail just eating healthier through (salad every other day and cooking most nights that I have time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this last one encompasses a number of things I think I need to go through. Although my friend circles aren't the same in Baltimore as in California, there are people I meet everyday that offer unique perspectives. Engaging in making relations is the first one. I haven't really explored doing "activities" for fun, such as hiking and exploring. I want to put myself out there and go on more "naturey" activites. I've had a lot of fun doing that in the past couple of months and I think it will only improve when I go into 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Begin to learn French: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using duolingo and trying to put myself out there with possibly a solo adventure to Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my research I have a very focused area that I am developing, but I want to become a thought leader in data science one day. The only way to do that is to continue my reading of papers unrelated to my research and continue my textbook reading of different topics, such as matrix theory and bayesian statistics. The more I understand, the more I might even be able to apply to my PhD research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping it under 10 this year because I recently read about Warren Buffet's 5/25 rule and am inspired by its logic. Happy 2017 everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Adam Li</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:adam2392.github.io,2016-12-31:/blog/2016/12/goals-2017/</guid><category>personal</category><category>goals</category></item><item><title>Personal Goals - 2016</title><link>https://adam2392.github.io/blog/2015/12/goals-2016/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Each year passes by faster and faster in my opinion, so I want to make the most out of 2016. As 2016 comes and 2015 comes to a close, I want to make some resolutions and goals for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I realized that even someone who you've known for years can exit your life in an instant. I want to spend more time and money on people that are there for you when you're up and down. When shit went down for me, people who I thought I could count on were nowhere to be seen. Why waste time and effort on those people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read more about politics and current events in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that coming from California is a blessing in many ways. However, I think that we take for granted all the things we have. There is a lot of different things happening around the country (e.g. politics) that I did not educate myself on. Using politico and pulse apps to keep up to date&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start choreographing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout undergrad, I made excuses for not trying more in dance to improve. Whether it was coursework, social life, or laziness, I didn't put in time and effort into my passion. Will try to do at least 1 piece and work on it throughout the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter in 1-2 jams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been bboying for almost 8 years and it has carried me through undergrad and high school. Want to continue going for top 8 in some big jams until I can't bboy anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad gave me his old Nikon D5000 and I got a GoPro at the beginning of the summer. Photography is a way for me to keep involved in the hip hop scene once I can't dance anymore. Videos and photos are also great of documenting the year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of challenges and obstacles to overcome to get to a PhD program. There are also many to overcome whilst in the program. I want to talk about various events including: preparing for grad school in undergrad, applying for grad school, applying for fellowships, picking your rotations, picking your coursework, picking your advisor, choosing a thesis committee, structuring and studying for your DBO and then research on a daily basis. My goal is to graduate from this PhD as soon as possible (ideally 4-5 years) and start working to get industry experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp;amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been saying that I wanna do this for years... time to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend less time on myself and volunteer more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spent too much time saying I wanna help out and not enough time doing. Getting involved in THREAD at Baltimore is one step and I hope to do more. The world is too big to just always be working on yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good for seeing friends and chatting. Good for sending some updates once in awhile and documenting photos/videos. Not good for productivity. Aim: go from online once/day to once/two days this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be content with paying my dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've always been anxious to accomplish things. However, over the next 4 years, I realized it'll be grind and work. Gaining the technical skills so I can set myself up for maximizing the probability of succeeding in a technical startup. Just have to be patient and have this same dream when I'm 29.
All resolutions are goals in my opinion. The only real way to accomplish a goal that you set your mind to is work on them in minimal increments. Happy new years. It's going to be a good one.&lt;/li&gt;
