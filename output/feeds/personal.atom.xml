I turned the big 2 5 (yay 1 year older). However, this year came with a lot of fun as I spent time at Coachella 2017, made it out for birthdays of my friends in Vegas, spent time in SF, LA, SD and Chicago visiting old friends, enjoyed new time with Hopkins friends in NYC, Boston and DC, and spent a lot of time enjoying my "relative" last year in Baltimore. I was fortunate enough to win three prestigious fellowships: the NSF-GRFP, Whitaker and Chateaubriand fellowships. I presented two conference papers at two different conferences, where I was even able to make a trip through Korea and Japan come out of it. It's ending with me being in France working with the Theoretical Neurosciences Group in Marseille. I am incredibly fortunate to be working in a group of extraordinary people from all different countries and backgrounds. I am learning so much and developing new ideas that I honestly can't say I would've had if I were just back in Baltimore. I think I have some explicit goals this year related to my work because I find it fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2017 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is actually something I thought would impact me a lot. I still watch hella dance vids online and keep up with hip hop news here and there, but I haven't touched the dance floor in a few months and it almost feels normal now. I get my daily excercise and I'm driven by my research and learning opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah I don't know if this will ever happen... So maybe I'll aim to do a 5k next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Read four new books: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always learn from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to be able to deadlift 245, and bench 205 this year. I've also started working out in the morning, or at least daily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I moved to France and have been traveling my ass off. I don't intend on stopping and I've found that I started to become more comfortable with just being by myself. You really learn a lot when you have to handle everything from beginning to end without a friend/family member watching your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Begin to learn French: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Duolingo and got to 2% fluency. Hell yeah. Well... I'm in France, so I started now LOL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was so set on the idea of data science last year, but it's all related to my interest in medicine, tech, and AI. I've been reading more papers here and there about random things ranging from deep neural networks, matrix perturbation theory, to deep reinforcement learning. None directly relate to my rsearch, but it's fascinating and great to think about how it can continue to impact my research and future growth as a data scientist / engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah I don't know why I thought this was feasible during a PhD. However, I've built a Node.js/D3.js web app at Lauz Hack this year! I'll be building my skills further as I design a complete system for data input, data analysis and data visualization for clinical usage within a Phase I clinical trial, that I will be helping lead in the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2018 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Travel [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be spending another 6-9 months in Marseille, France. I truly enjoy having this opportunity to live in Europe for not just one semester, but one year. However, I don't think I will ever choose to live here long term, so I want to take advantage of the majority of the time I have left here and go traveling... A LOT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently this year, I've visited London, Paris, Lyon, Marrackech, Casablanca, Munich, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Lausanne, Geneva, Cambridge, Oxford, Whales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my travel goals for this year are two parts:
i. I'm going to try to visit:
Lisbon [ ], 
Oslo [ ], 
Helsinki [ ], 
Stockholm [ ], 
Nice [ ], 
Monaco [ ], 
Istanbul [ ], 
Athens [ ], 
Santorini [ ],
Croatia [ ], 
Barcelona [ ], 
Amsterdam [ ], 
Luxembourg [ ], 
Bordeaux [ ], 
Berlin [ ], 
Frankfurt [ ], 
Rome [ ], 
Bologna [ ], &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. The things I'm going to try to attend are Tomorrowland 2018 [ ] and Yacht week 2018 [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Academic [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been able to finish two conference papers, and a journal paper as first author. I've also served as an author on two additional conference papers. This upcoming year, I want to delve deeper into the intersection of my current work with machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to submit two conference papers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on initial results of fragility tested on TVB and [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial results of a DNN tested on TVB for seizure detection. [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to submit a journal paper for a complete retrospective study on the fragility algorithm [ ] and an Bayesian inference implementation of the final layer of prediction of the EZ set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to enroll in a class on Matrix Theory, Stochastic Optimization and Nonlinear Optimization. These are three topics I feel like I have to understand at a deeper level to fundamentally be able to tackle many generic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Professional [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the time is approaching when I will be thinking about graduation from the PhD program at JHU. It feels like a lifetime ago that I was a nervous wreck joining JHU and wondering if I was smart enough to keep up with some of the cutting edge research in BME. I think I still have some issues with where I feel in terms of knowledge. My goal is to augment and seal up those weaknesses / shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got my short term eyes set on a few companies and positions that I have heard great things about. I am excited at the possibility of learning even more by joining mathematics, free-thinking, machine learning and data expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here is to submit applications to DE Shaw LLC, DE Shaw Research, Google Brain Research Team, DeepMind, Facebook Research, Amazon Data Science, Amazon Health Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in order to make it within these groups, I should develop my fundamental computer science skills further by creating in C++ and Python the various data structures and Cracking the Code Interview problem sets. I should have a fundamental understanding of backpropagation, optimization, probability, statistics, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ review of data structures [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python review of data structures [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of backpropagation [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of machine learning basics [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Personal [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've picked up photography and I enjoy just posting on Instagram/Facebook, photos that I take, that I like. I've stopped dancing, but I've started working out on a consistent basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to reach a 
- bench of 225 [ ], 
- a deadlift of 275 [ ] and 
- consistent running of 1-5 miles (by the end of the year) [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Cooking and Lifestyle [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be cooking at least 5 times a week, so that I can maintain a healthy diet. I will look at maintaining a combination of recipes and learning something new every other month! I'll keep an update here on the recipes I learn and experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken Breast [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steak [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pasta With Meat [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salmon Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuna Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Fish Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(if possible): Other seafood [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Reading and Knowledge [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to continuously be reading from highly regarded sources. I want to conssistently read from sources on Twitter, The World Economic Review and Bloomberg. I'll try to update some of my thoughts on the different mechanisms of obtaining knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep up with my intake of knowledge, I want to challenge myself to write a series of publically available blog posts on trends in technology, medicine, politics and economics/finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin [X]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ethereum/blockchain [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;machine learning/AI [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foreign markets (EU/Asia) and cryptocurrency/blockchains [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emerging markets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Personal Goals - 2017</title><link href="/blog/2016/12/goals-2017/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Li</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-12-31:/blog/2016/12/goals-2017/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A summary of goals for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on one of the best years ever, I'm grateful for all the people and places that made these memories happen. I took some time around 1 year ago to plan out ten things I wanted to carry out in 2016. I've enjoyed it a lot because it's been a goal to work towards for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I want to look at what I set out to do, and where I've come in regards to those goals. It will be interesting to see how my own priorities simply a year ago changed throughout the year and what I want to keep and discard for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2016 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitely did it with Vegas trips, Coachella, Asia traveling, San Francisco, Chicago and New York City. All were done with great friends that I would take a bullet for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Read more about politics and current events in our country. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I think this year was a turmoil in the United States with Donald Trump having been elected. Personally, I was spurred to follow and read more news through Twitter, Facebook and news journal sites. Although I have yet to become an expert, it has definitely exposed me to thought leaders ranging from Democratic/Republican leaders to news journalists to high ranking company executives. I've begun formulating my own thoughts on the topic (which I won't go into) and I think it's really helped me think about what I want for my future, my family's future, my children's future and my country's future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Start choreographing again. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Totally did not do this. Will have to put this on a higher priority list this year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Enter in 1-2 jams. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hurt my ankle during the time frame when I could've definitely entered the jam at Johns Hopkins. I'm pretty disappointed though that I didn't try to do more while it was summer time and I was still relatively free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I definitely had a late start this year by only doing this towards the end of 2016, but I'm definitely getting more into it. I've learned the basics of manipulating aperture, shutter speed and angles. It's really fun and I'm surprised by how excited I get over good photos and photo opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think logging experiences in graduate school are important, but more important are reaching those milestones. I've realized how tough different aspects of the PhD are and I think for 2017 I would want to focus more effort on tangibly meeting milestones in graduate school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp;amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got lazy and then my ankle got hurt, but I definitely want to try again for 2017!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Spend less time on myself and volunteer more. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I don't think I've done this at all, but in a different interpretation I've focused more on making an impact outside of research. I'm very excited to say that I started HEME (Hopkins Engineering Medicine Exchange) with one of my close friends in graduate school and I have big dreams for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9. Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat). [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't do a great job towards the beginning because I think as all millennials are, I was addicted to seeing how other people's lives were progressing. However, simply today, one of my good friends showed me a video I think is worth sharing. (https://www.facebook.com/deltaprotective/videos/10157890106040640/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED) I want to spend even less time by keeping "Kill News Feed" and using Instagram/Facebook simply to log photographs I take and memories I want to engrave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Be content with paying my dues. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this year I started to examine what excites me in life and what excites me about the future. It definitely isn't working at some corporate 9-5 job (even if I think the job is "impactful"). It's innovating and pushing the bounds of medicine using engineering, mathematics and computer programming. These topics are what excite me, while medicine is what spurs me to make a difference. I'm looking forward to spending ~5 (hopefully) years at Johns Hopkins absorbing different learning experiences and getting my Masters in Applied Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics while I'm also there. Why not get a free additional education with the PhD while I'm there?
6/10 kinda. I guess not bad :p.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New 2017 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I might not be able to choreograph a piece, participate in jams and get involved in dance photography, I want to simply keep bboying, keep taking choreo classes and keep my camera/gopro at all major dance events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to start running couple miles at the gym every other day and hopefully do one in the spring :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Read four new books: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, I've managed to read ~4 books due to a book club established with my friends and I. It's made me more engaged in my own self development because I spent less time on social media and video games before sleeping. I want to do it again with or without another book club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been exercising at the gym more this year and I'm pretty happy with where I've gotten. I think being able to deadlift 245 and bench 225 are solid goals to have for this year. While continuing dancing, I hope to live a healthier lifestyle. In addition, this could entail just eating healthier through (salad every other day and cooking most nights that I have time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this last one encompasses a number of things I think I need to go through. Although my friend circles aren't the same in Baltimore as in California, there are people I meet everyday that offer unique perspectives. Engaging in making relations is the first one. I haven't really explored doing "activities" for fun, such as hiking and exploring. I want to put myself out there and go on more "naturey" activites. I've had a lot of fun doing that in the past couple of months and I think it will only improve when I go into 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Begin to learn French: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using duolingo and trying to put myself out there with possibly a solo adventure to Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my research I have a very focused area that I am developing, but I want to become a thought leader in data science one day. The only way to do that is to continue my reading of papers unrelated to my research and continue my textbook reading of different topics, such as matrix theory and bayesian statistics. The more I understand, the more I might even be able to apply to my PhD research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping it under 10 this year because I recently read about Warren Buffet's 5/25 rule and am inspired by its logic. Happy 2017 everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Personal Goals - 2016</title><link href="/blog/2015/12/goals-2016/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Li</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-12-31:/blog/2015/12/goals-2016/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A summary of goals for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Each year passes by faster and faster in my opinion, so I want to make the most out of 2016. As 2016 comes and 2015 comes to a close, I want to make some resolutions and goals for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest.
- This year I realized that even someone who you've known for years can exit your life in an instant. I want to spend more time and money on people that are there for you when you're up and down. When shit went down for me, people who I thought I could count on were nowhere to be seen. Why waste time and effort on those people?
Read more about politics and current events in our country.
- I think that coming from California is a blessing in many ways. However, I think that we take for granted all the things we have. There is a lot of different things happening around the country (e.g. politics) that I did not educate myself on. Using politico and pulse apps to keep up to date
Start choreographing again.
- Throughout undergrad, I made excuses for not trying more in dance to improve. Whether it was coursework, social life, or laziness, I didn't put in time and effort into my passion. Will try to do at least 1 piece and work on it throughout the year.
Enter in 1-2 jams.
- Been bboying for almost 8 years and it has carried me through undergrad and high school. Want to continue going for top 8 in some big jams until I can't bboy anymore.
Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them.
- My dad gave me his old Nikon D5000 and I got a GoPro at the beginning of the summer. Photography is a way for me to keep involved in the hip hop scene once I can't dance anymore. Videos and photos are also great of documenting the year!
Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM.
- There are a lot of challenges and obstacles to overcome to get to a PhD program. There are also many to overcome whilst in the program. I want to talk about various events including: preparing for grad school in undergrad, applying for grad school, applying for fellowships, picking your rotations, picking your coursework, picking your advisor, choosing a thesis committee, structuring and studying for your DBO and then research on a daily basis. My goal is to graduate from this PhD as soon as possible (ideally 4-5 years) and start working to get industry experience.
Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp;amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC
- Been saying that I wanna do this for years... time to get started.
Spend less time on myself and volunteer more.
- Spent too much time saying I wanna help out and not enough time doing. Getting involved in THREAD at Baltimore is one step and I hope to do more. The world is too big to just always be working on yourself.
Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat).
- Good for seeing friends and chatting. Good for sending some updates once in awhile and documenting photos/videos. Not good for productivity. Aim: go from online once/day to once/two days this year.
Be content with paying my dues.
- I've always been anxious to accomplish things. However, over the next 4 years, I realized it'll be grind and work. Gaining the technical skills so I can set myself up for maximizing the probability of succeeding in a technical startup. Just have to be patient and have this same dream when I'm 29.
All resolutions are goals in my opinion. The only real way to accomplish a goal that you set your mind to is work on them in minimal increments. In entrepreneurship, they call these minimal viable products (MVPs). Everyone should check back on these goals at least once/month over 2016 to see how they're doing and work on them like they're MVPs. Won't that make for an even more exciting 2017? Happy new years. It's going to be a good one.
