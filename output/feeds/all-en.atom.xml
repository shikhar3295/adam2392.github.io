&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Schipol Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a large international airport that has a train service to the Amsterdam Centraal station in the center of Amsterdam. It costs ~5 euros to buy a ticket, but the ticket booths only accept credit cards with a pin number, so you may need to go to the actual ticket office to buy yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Else it costs around 30 euros to uber from the center of Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend buying a metro pass here if you can for the length of your stay because it gives you access to all the buses and trams in the city (which are very frequent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The airport is rather efficient, so I was able to get through security and check into a lounge always after arriving 1 hour early (assuming you don't have bag check).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. De Gooyer Windmill (and Brewery!)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an old windmill that was renovated to become a brewery at the bottom. Come here and take a photo of the picturesque windmill and have some great locally brewed beers! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brewery is only open till 8PM though. There is also a great burrito (Burrito Annonymous) place across the street, which is great if you're missing Mexican food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Red Light District&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex shows, prostitutes in windows, sex shops and a very red lit district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Van Gogh Museum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You DEFINITELY have to book your tickets in advance. It is well worth it because you get 4 floors of Van Gogh as he progresses through his short life. He was only 27 when he began painting! Yet, he became one of the most famous artists in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went, they also have other artists there who were an inspiration, or part of Van Gogh's life. Great for impressionist/portrait lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Rijksmuseum&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went, you could still buy tickets at the office outside near the IAmsterdam sign, but a lot of people recommend buying online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a great museum that houses some of the famous Dutch painters, most famously Rembrandt. He painted a lot of great portraits, with the most well-known being "The Nights Watch" (cue GoT fans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Anne-Frank House&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worth visiting, and you HAVE TO buy tickets in advance. I think the worth behind this is self-explanatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Indonesian Food (Cafe Kadijk)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian food is big in the Netherlands because they used to be a trading country. A lot of places can be overpriced though (even if they are good), but I found this place to be fairly priced and actually very great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Seafood Bar (Spui)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seafood market that has fresh seafood and amazing chefs. Extremely worth your money, but make sure you make a reservation by stopping by, or through their website! (http://www.theseafoodbar.com/)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Stroopwafels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfect for dipping in your coffee and for buying as a gift for colleagues, friends and loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Rembrandt Square&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A square with a bunch of cafes and bars around the entire square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Shelter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very famous house/techno club that will probably require you to buy tickets to get in, but it is a very cool Amsterdam experience. I also really like the music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Jimmy Woos&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an American style club that will probably play EDM/HipHop and is styled with an Asian theme. Pretty cool, and they also have a lot of bars around the area. There is a bar across the street from the entrance that has live music and cheap drinks for a 2 euro entrance fee!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can definitely use the tram/bus system in Amsterdam! I recommend buying the multi-day passes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is completely walking the city (uhh), or renting a bike and getting around like the locals do.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category><category term="europe"></category><category term="netherlands"></category><category term="amsterdam"></category></entry><entry><title>Travel - Switzerland</title><link href="/blog/2018/01/travel-switzerland/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-01-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Li</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-01-01:/blog/2018/01/travel-switzerland/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A summary of how to visit Switzerland and get the most out of your trip.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Europe - Switzerland&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Lucerne (Luzern)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucerne is a great small town that can be a base for you to visit Mount Pilatus, and Mount Rigi. It is very nice and has a nice looking bridge called "Chapel Bridge" and a cool monument called the Injured Lion Statue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Mount Pilatus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making this climb to the top by cable car is really worth it. It will cost you about ~50 CF total round trip, but at the top there is a hotel for skiiers in the winter and also has a beautiful view of Lucerne and the surrounding area from the top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a cool walking area that can take you inside the mountain peak for different vantage points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Zurich&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. Rhine Falls (Neuhausen)
Amazing waterfall area that is only a 30 minute train ride away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. Uetilburg
A very nice mountain hiking area that is only a 20 minute train ride out of the city. It features a nice overlook of Zurich and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iii. Fifa Museum
This shows all the history behind the FIFA organization. Very cool place to check out for any soccer fans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Geneva&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. CERN
This is where the infamous Hadron Collider is! This is where the Higgs Boson was discovered, and where there is very important physics research going on everyday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Volkshaus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice night club with 3 different rooms for 3 differnet music types. Needs cash only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Langstrasse Street&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a street within Zurich that features many bars and clubs for all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around would be the SBB trains and possibly uber. The trains go over the entire country, so this is extremely worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Should I get a Swiss Travel Pass?
This depends on where you are staying and how long you are staying in Switzerland! The minimum multi-day pass is 3 days, so this is definitely worth it if you say plan on going to 3 different mountains because it covers your fee for all the trains and also the cable cars up, which can get pretty expensive!&lt;/li&gt;

This assumes that the reader has heard of cryptocurrency and might have the most basic understanding of its underlying technology. I do not presume to be an expert in cryptography, blockchain, the internet, or anything for that matter. I simply wish to express my views for the sake of learning from other’s viewpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Personal View on Bitcoin&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bitcoin is going to change the world.” A few words that I heard in 2014 at a startup conference that stuck with me for the next few years. As an engineer, I looked into bitcoin, blockchain and the technologies that began making headlines (e.g. ethereum, litecoin, etc.). My research led me to make investments into cryptocurrency. However, with the recent explosion of Bitcoin throughout the media, I formed a more rigorous hypothesis that led me to question mainstream thinking. Basing my thoughts on a semi-technical understanding of blockchain and basic economics knowledge, I arrive at three main argument points on the validity of bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will bitcoin be able to become a currency that is widely used? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will bitcoin become a valued asset that yields significant dividends? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will bitcoin become a mode of intermediate to long term value storage like gold? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I address all three points from what I have researched and experienced with the conclusion that bitcoin is not worth the financial hype. (Similar blockchain technologies like ethereum are another topic for another time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will do my best to break each general question into a series of hierarchical simple questions. These will guide my thinking and I hope I can convince to come to the same conclusions I have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Bitcoin Become a Largely Used Currency?:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Society uses currency as a way of exchanging value and goods. Traditionally we defined goods as perhaps a cow, spices or leather goods. Instead of trading refined tea leaves for a pair of leather shoes, we come to an agreement on a common value holder. We agree that tea leaves are worth $X and therefore one would be willing to trade leather shoes for $X knowing that they can then use $X to buy tea leaves. We need currency because this enables this fundamental exchange of goods and services. Now enters bitcoin. A disruptor within the currency world. A David to the US dollar’s Goliath. It becomes easy to be blinded by the trillions of value that the USD holds, whether it is in retirement funds, or global banks. As a currency, it is necessary that there is universal usage and stability. Having USD is only valuable because there are many people that are willing to exchange goods and services for it because they know that it has a universal value. The USD is stable in that purchasing goods for $10 one day probably means that those goods are still worth $10 the next. Bitcoin is slightly flawed and different in a few ways that are important to note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that Bitcoin has wild fluctuations in pricing. If people are buying into bitcoin believing it can be the currency of the next-generation and this causes massive fluctuations, then this is inherently contradictory. No one will use Bitcoin as a currency if buying goods for 5 Bitcoin costs 1 Bitcoin, or 200 Bitcoins in the next hour. This then leads to the next point of Bitcoin as having universal usage. While it is true that Bitcoin overcomes many barriers in global transactions that current transaction systems have, it still will not become universally accepted. It has the technical features that can allow it to be easily universally accepted, but it is up to society to implement paths to accept Bitcoin as a method of payment. However, in order to be universally accepted as a currency, it has to demonstrate that it can function as a currency. This leads to a circular dependency that will be hard to solve given Bitcoin’s limited functionality. Without true universal usage and stability, Bitcoin will not be able to achieve status as a widely used currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Bitcoin Become a Dividend Yielding Asset?:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks and bitcoin dreamers have one thing in common. Their value is tied to the assets and value that they provide society. We buy equity in Amazon because we think their value will increase in the future. We think that because we believe their total market cap (valuation) will continue growing. Bitcoin has been touted to possibly be able to act as a secure, fast, and robust transaction system. Many people buy into bitcoin because they think it will accumulate future value. This is falsely over exaggerated. Bitcoin as of now and the foreseeable future is only capable of creating value in society for certain transactions. Its use in society would be to provide services as a transaction system. If we buy in believing that we will get a return on investment, then we believe that its service provided will continue to increase in value. So this argument line is predicated on the ability of bitcoin to increase its value add as a transaction system to society. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without getting into the technical details of bitcoin and blockchain, I present three examples of how this is highly unlikely. Firstly, bitcoin transactions are currently dependent on expensive hardware, which incur large electricity bills. This builds a reliance on centralized mining organizations formed and it is important to note that much of the computing power is located in China, under the jurisdiction of the government there. This demonstrates two unintentional flaws in the bitcoin network: centralization and unlikely scalability. Bitcoin was designed to be decentralized to incur all the benefits that would come with it (I would encourage everyone to do their own research into this, since it is a complex topic itself). However, due to the nature of mining on the bitcoin network, mining organizations have formed, which inherently form centralized hubs of bitcoin network computing. Secondly, bitcoin scalability heavily relies on expensive hardware, which is not readily accessible by the average consumer. The idea of scaling bitcoin, so that it is completely decentralized with most consumers contributing to the network to process transactions is flawed. Most average users will not buy expensive hardware to contribute to the bitcoin network and those that do will most likely join a mining organization, thereby preventing scalability and decentralization. This in turn argues against the idea that bitcoin has a future value tied to its ability to become a largely implemented transaction system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might ask how Bitcoin might overcome this reliance on expensive hardware to solve these downstream problems? There has been online conversations of changing the Bitcoin network’s internal infrastructure. Currently bitcoin uses a very secure algorithm called, Proof-of-work (PoW), which relies on a lot of heavy computing power to process transactions. There are other algorithms that have been in academic research, and have shown improved scalability and speed. One such example is Proof-of-stake (PoS), which has been shown to be just as secure under certain assumptions. The largest difference is that PoS will not rely on heavy computing power, thus enabling the average consumer to become part of the blockchain network and extinguish the need for centralized mining organizations. However, Bitcoin has shown that it will not take action to implement any changes like this. Unfortunately, the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, has faded into the shadows in terms of contributing a voice to the direction of Bitcoin. Thus, there is no evangelist that can lead the charge in voicing necessary changes to the Bitcoin network. Most users and developers on the network have differing views on how Bitcoin can be improved, but without a centralized leader to take charge on these improvements, they are unlikely to occur. A slight tangential example can be seen in Ethereum, where the creator and evangelist of Ethereum has taken a strong voice in leading the most important improvements to Ethereum. If Bitcoin chooses to implement various changes to the network, then it is quite possible by that time, there are new cryptocurrencies that were built and designed to overcome these various challenges from the start. Then one might ask, what is the point of owning Bitcoin over these other coins that actually have more potential value add to society? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can Bitcoin Become an Intermediate/Long Term Value Storage?:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This final view on Bitcoin is slightly related to its potential as a currency, but with some differences. A value storage asset is something like a house, gold, or jewelry, where the value is retained over time (or grows for that matter). The primary necessity for any value storage are liquidity and a limited supply. Gold and Bitcoin both have fundamental economics that drive their pricing. There is a limited supply, and demand for this supply will determine its pricing. We have talked about how demand for this supply might come in the form of using it as a currency, or holding it as a value-incurring asset. Now, I discuss a related point of using Bitcoin as a vehicle for storing value. For any average consumer, putting money into gold means that you want to be able to extract the value of that money at any time, and expect similar, if not grown value. This is similar to its properties as a currency. Gold is an example of a liquid investment because it is able to be sold easily at any time and maintains a relatively stable pricing. This is contrary to Bitcoin, where prices fluctuate wildly and it is not as easily converted into cash. It is true that there are now many Bitcoin exchanges where Bitcoin can be sold and converted into cash. However, these are subject to centralized regulations from governments. For example, just recently, China enforced some heavy regulations that shut down cryptocurrency operations within the country. So even though consumers can directly use the Bitcoin network to liquidate their Bitcoin investment, it is highly unlikely that many consumers will have the tools and knowledge to be able to do so. Thus, they rely on these centralized exchanges that have been shown to be subject to the whims of the local government. Although Bitcoin has a limited supply, it has unintended flaws in its liquidity that do not allow it to become an attractive vehicle for long term value storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, to a problem with liquidity, there is a problem with competition. In rare metals, like gold and platinum, there are no gold replicas, or platinum replicas; there is only gold and platinum. With bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there is an explosion in different implementations and designs that seek to improve on the original bitcoin. These create digital competitions in the sense that, we cannot have multiple “irreplaceable digital gold.” This is inherently contradictory, and so the argument that bitcoin can be a replacement for gold does not hold true because of these alternative coins that have more or less the same functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions and Summary:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I've discussed three viewpoints of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency: i) usage as a currency, ii) a dividend-yielding asset, and iii) a "digital gold" as a value storage. While all these points of view have some valid arguments in favor of Bitcoin, they have some underlying flaws that are hard to solve. They are hard to solve because of numerous reasons, but in my opinion, it is due to the way Bitcoin was originally designed and it's mechanisms for change. I think that a truly successful cryptocurrency will be able to encompass all three viewpoints by not only having a well-thought-out initial design, but also a robust mechanism for changing the blockchain operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin has a lot of problems. Nonetheless, it is the first mainstream technology of its kind, and it will spur a generation of technologies that will change the world for the better.&lt;/p&gt;

I turned the big 2 5 (yay 1 year older). However, this year came with a lot of fun as I spent time at Coachella 2017, made it out for birthdays of my friends in Vegas, spent time in SF, LA, SD and Chicago visiting old friends, enjoyed new time with Hopkins friends in NYC, Boston and DC, and spent a lot of time enjoying my "relative" last year in Baltimore. I was fortunate enough to win three prestigious fellowships: the NSF-GRFP, Whitaker and Chateaubriand fellowships. I presented two conference papers at two different conferences, where I was even able to make a trip through Korea and Japan come out of it. It's ending with me being in France working with the Theoretical Neurosciences Group in Marseille. I am incredibly fortunate to be working in a group of extraordinary people from all different countries and backgrounds. I am learning so much and developing new ideas that I honestly can't say I would've had if I were just back in Baltimore. I think I have some explicit goals this year related to my work because I find it fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2017 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is actually something I thought would impact me a lot. I still watch hella dance vids online and keep up with hip hop news here and there, but I haven't touched the dance floor in a few months and it almost feels normal now. I get my daily excercise and I'm driven by my research and learning opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah I don't know if this will ever happen... So maybe I'll aim to do a 5k next year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Read four new books: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always learn from others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got to be able to deadlift 245, and bench 205 this year. I've also started working out in the morning, or at least daily. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I moved to France and have been traveling my ass off. I don't intend on stopping and I've found that I started to become more comfortable with just being by myself. You really learn a lot when you have to handle everything from beginning to end without a friend/family member watching your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Begin to learn French: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Used Duolingo and got to 2% fluency. Hell yeah. Well... I'm in France, so I started now LOL.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was so set on the idea of data science last year, but it's all related to my interest in medicine, tech, and AI. I've been reading more papers here and there about random things ranging from deep neural networks, matrix perturbation theory, to deep reinforcement learning. None directly relate to my rsearch, but it's fascinating and great to think about how it can continue to impact my research and future growth as a data scientist / engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yeah I don't know why I thought this was feasible during a PhD. However, I've built a Node.js/D3.js web app at Lauz Hack this year! I'll be building my skills further as I design a complete system for data input, data analysis and data visualization for clinical usage within a Phase I clinical trial, that I will be helping lead in the next few years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2018 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Travel [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be spending another 6-9 months in Marseille, France. I truly enjoy having this opportunity to live in Europe for not just one semester, but one year. However, I don't think I will ever choose to live here long term, so I want to take advantage of the majority of the time I have left here and go traveling... A LOT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently this year, I've visited London, Paris, Lyon, Marrackech, Casablanca, Munich, Vienna, Prague, Budapest, Lausanne, Geneva, Cambridge, Oxford, Whales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my travel goals for this year are two parts:
i. I'm going to try to visit:
Lisbon [ ], 
Oslo [ ], 
Helsinki [ ], 
Stockholm [ ], 
Nice [ ], 
Monaco [ ], 
Istanbul [ ], 
Athens [ ], 
Santorini [ ],
Croatia [ ], 
Barcelona [ ], 
Amsterdam [ ], 
Luxembourg [ ], 
Bordeaux [ ], 
Berlin [ ], 
Frankfurt [ ], 
Rome [ ], 
Bologna [ ], &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ii. The things I'm going to try to attend are Tomorrowland 2018 [ ] and Yacht week 2018 [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Academic [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been able to finish two conference papers, and a journal paper as first author. I've also served as an author on two additional conference papers. This upcoming year, I want to delve deeper into the intersection of my current work with machine learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to submit two conference papers: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;on initial results of fragility tested on TVB and [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial results of a DNN tested on TVB for seizure detection. [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to submit a journal paper for a complete retrospective study on the fragility algorithm [ ] and an Bayesian inference implementation of the final layer of prediction of the EZ set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to enroll in a class on Matrix Theory, Stochastic Optimization and Nonlinear Optimization. These are three topics I feel like I have to understand at a deeper level to fundamentally be able to tackle many generic problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Professional [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the time is approaching when I will be thinking about graduation from the PhD program at JHU. It feels like a lifetime ago that I was a nervous wreck joining JHU and wondering if I was smart enough to keep up with some of the cutting edge research in BME. I think I still have some issues with where I feel in terms of knowledge. My goal is to augment and seal up those weaknesses / shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got my short term eyes set on a few companies and positions that I have heard great things about. I am excited at the possibility of learning even more by joining mathematics, free-thinking, machine learning and data expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal here is to submit applications to DE Shaw LLC, DE Shaw Research, Google Brain Research Team, DeepMind, Facebook Research, Amazon Data Science, Amazon Health Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think in order to make it within these groups, I should develop my fundamental computer science skills further by creating in C++ and Python the various data structures and Cracking the Code Interview problem sets. I should have a fundamental understanding of backpropagation, optimization, probability, statistics, and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;C++ review of data structures [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Python review of data structures [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of backpropagation [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Math review of machine learning basics [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Personal [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've picked up photography and I enjoy just posting on Instagram/Facebook, photos that I take, that I like. I've stopped dancing, but I've started working out on a consistent basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to reach a 
- bench of 225 [ ], 
- a deadlift of 275 [ ] and 
- consistent running of 1-5 miles (by the end of the year) [ ].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Cooking and Lifestyle [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to be cooking at least 5 times a week, so that I can maintain a healthy diet. I will look at maintaining a combination of recipes and learning something new every other month! I'll keep an update here on the recipes I learn and experiment with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chicken Breast [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steak [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pasta With Meat [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salmon Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuna Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other Fish Dish [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(if possible): Other seafood [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Reading and Knowledge [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to continuously be reading from highly regarded sources. I want to conssistently read from sources on Twitter, The World Economic Review and Bloomberg. I'll try to update some of my thoughts on the different mechanisms of obtaining knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to keep up with my intake of knowledge, I want to challenge myself to write a series of publically available blog posts on trends in technology, medicine, politics and economics/finance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bitcoin [X]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ethereum/blockchain [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;machine learning/AI [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;politics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foreign markets (EU/Asia) and cryptocurrency/blockchains [ ]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;emerging markets&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freesurfer is a tool built for rendering 3D brains using MRI and Ct scans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSL is a tool for coregistration and image analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download both online:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Common Definitions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registration: to find a common coordinate system for the input data sets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you will want to download freesurfer from the following website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall
Linux:
    ## bash
    $&amp;gt; export FREESURFER_HOME=/usr/local/freesurfer
    $&amp;gt; source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;## tcsh
$&amp;gt; setenv FREESURFER_HOME /usr/local/freesurfer
$&amp;gt; source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.csh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mac:
    $&amp;gt; export FREESURFER_HOME=/Applications/freesurfer
    $&amp;gt; source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run those commands within your terminal, or add them to ~/.bashrc file to have access to all the command line tools for freeview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need to setup your own directory where you will hold all your subject data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;export SUBJECTS_DIR=&amp;lt;path to subject data&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will be where you store say patient's MRI/CT scans that you will use to reconstruct the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Running Through T1-Weighted MRI Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you want to set your current Subjects directory to where you are working with the raw say .dcm data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;export SUBJECTS_DIR=$PWD
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There may be an issue where you can't run the functions with your .dcm files. I have no idea why this occurs, but an easy fix is to externally run a dicom to nii converter and pass this type of file instead. Here is a link to a matlab converter that can do this:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42997-dicom-to-nifti-converter--nifti-tool-and-viewer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also other resources online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, you can run the following command(s):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;recon-all -i &amp;lt;data&amp;gt;.nii -s &amp;lt;subject_name&amp;gt; -autorecon1
recon-all -i &amp;lt;data&amp;gt;.nii -s &amp;lt;subject_name&amp;gt; -all
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will take a long time! So be prepared to run this on a compute engine that has time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Running Through CT Images&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flirt -in patient_ct.nii -ref patient_mri.nii -omat patient_omat.mat -out patient_registered.nii.gz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will coregister the CT data onto the domain of the MRI data and provide a coregistration for you to look at where certain contacts of electrodes are. You can also view in Freeview the different cuts of the brain using either CT, or MRI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Getting Surface Parcellations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Getting SEEG XYZ Coordinates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have CT images coregistered with MRI images, you can easily extract the locations of all iEEG contacts in the MRI axis system. This is done by noting a contact within each electrode (e.g. A1, B1, C10, etc.) and then an algorithm can fill in the entire electrode's xyz coordinates and output to a file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;References:&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need airbnb (you'll get a free $40 off):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH"&gt;https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need taxify (you'll get a free $5 off!):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D"&gt;https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sample Itinerary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gYT-UxSW0CtTBlGOznBtBnpnF5huMIQmP7xUmOPhynE/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Charles' Optimized Itin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Budapest International Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note, that this city doesn't have uber, so taxify or hailing a taxi is the way to go. The public transportation also works, but it requires some transfers, and honestly it's worth the money and the time to just take a taxi. Use the taixify link to download the app prior!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights/Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Szechenyi Baths&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a in &amp;amp; outdoor thermal spa, which is very picturesque and features a cool experience in varying bath temperatures. Totally worth coming no matter what time of year it is! Make sure you have enough money to either rent a towel (~$4), or bring your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. River Danube Tour&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the Chicago architecture tour (which is awesome btw). However, I would highly recommend coming at nighttime. It gets a bit chilly, so if you have a blanket, bring that along in your backpack. Nighttime features the famous Hungarian Parliament building in all its golden glory. Make sure you get a good spot set up to take photos. In addition, most river tours give a free drink on board, so you can continue getting drinks and just get drunk while checking out the most beautiful night views in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Matthias Church / Buda Castle / Fisherman's Bastion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This area in the Buda side is just so picturesque, you have to come here. You have a terrific view of the entire Budapest city and the architecture is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. St. Stephen's Basilisque&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a really nice looking church in the center of the city on the pest side&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Hungarian Parliament Building&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just cause you saw this on the river danube tour, doesn't mean you shouldn't come see it again during the day! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. KonyvBar &amp;amp; Restaurant&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book-themed restaurant that is totally worth booking a reservation for (else you probably can't get in). When I went, it was Harry Potter themed and I ordered a "Crystal ball". Fantastic meal and fantastic experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Gelato Rosa&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very nice looking gelato in the shape of flowers. Great for those instagram posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Ruin Bars:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the famous bars that are within the "ruins" of Budapest, which came about from the various bombings during the world wars. It's really cool, but make sure you bring some cash to buy drinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Peaches &amp;amp; Cream&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some night club that plays top 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, taxify/taxis are an affordable option!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would recommend staying on the Pest side of Budapest because there is more night life and restaurants there. The buda side is a nice place to walk to for all the historical sites.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;1. Lyon Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Basilisque Notre Dame Foire:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially another basilisque that is very beautiful and overlooks Lyon. It has an amazing view of the city. If you want nice lighting, I suggest coming in the middle to late afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is located on Fourviere Hill. Note that Google maps shows a circular route to take up the hill, but there is a staircase at the bottom that goes straight up. You just have to find it :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Vieux Lyon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic area of the city that is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Le Mur Des Canuts:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge mural on the side of a building in the northern part of Lyon. It is incredibly picturesque and it's very fun to just try different poses to fit into the mural!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Musée Des Beaux-arts de Lyon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest fine art museum after the Louvre in Paris. It is only 4 euros for a student, so it is highly recommended to go and check out some great art! There are some Monet pieces in here that are absolutely amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Parc de La Tete d’Or:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a super cool looking park, known as the Golden Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Slake:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic coffee cafe that serves some great breakfast foods, like quiche, sandwiches and cookies. Highly recommend as a start off to your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Yaafa:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially a vegetarian falafel shop that is extremely affordable and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend coming here if you're just sick and tired of French food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Bollywood Tandoor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an authentic Indian restaurant that also serves a buffet style portion. It's not bad and pretty affordable too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Lyonnaise Cuisine:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be in Lyon, then you absolutely have to try Lyonnaise cuisine once. Go on Tripadvisor and make a reservation for a heavily reviewed restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Wine Drinking On the Rhone:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the Rhone, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, Uber is plentiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the rivers Rhone and Saone towards the center of the city, else you'll spend an incredible amount of time walking/ubering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Prague International Airport | Vaclave Havel Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is highly recommended to get a taxi that for certain takes credit card. Most taxis will try to scam you and say their credit card machine stopped working. Ask before getting in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights/Activities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Kafe Damu&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 70 cent beers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Prague Castle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like Prague Art and Architecture you will go into St. Vitus, and probably into St. Georges Basilica and to Golden Lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is actually one of the most beautiful castles I've been to and has some really nice architecture. There are also a lot of museums around the area worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i. Castle Gardens (not open in Winter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. National Gallery in Prague&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Parizska Street and Old Town Square&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a really old town area that is nice to walk through and appreciate the Czech architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Piss Sculpture in New Town (English book store with Shakespeare)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a really funny looking sculpture there. It also has a famous museum for the writer: Franz Kafka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Krizik Fountain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Charles Bridge&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the infamous Charles Bridge. A lot of tourists and people taking wedding photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sure to also check out their river tours to get another point of view of this famous and historical bridge.

&lt;h4&gt;8. Prague Clock Tower&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really pretty looking clock tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Globe Cafe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great breakfast and lunch for american food. Has Wifi and a great place to study. Good colonel Panini and French onion soup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Bohemia Bagels&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice bagels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Lunch:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Kolkovna Celnice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snchnitzel is great with cornflake bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Fried Cheese Stands (at end of Wenceclas towards National Museum):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Street food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Sklep:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authentic Czech food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Nase Maso&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is literally the best meat place you will ever find. It features some local butcher that also cooks some meat meals for you on the spot. There is always a line and they serve a really great cheeseburger, bone marrow, steak tartare and sausages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dinner:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Ristorante Grosetto Marina – on a boat by the river, so good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice restaurant and decently priced for being right on the river!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Dessert:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. ANGELATO&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gelato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;1. Hemminway Bar – authentic absinthe&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the coolest absinthe bar ever! It features loads of cool drinks that are hand made by the bartenders and has some really cool photos and history behind it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;2. Prague Beer Museum&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 30 beers on tap and you can buy taste cups. Gets crowded on the weekends though, but beer lovers must go here. It's not actually a museum)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Must try beers:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kout na Smunave &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staropramen (brewed in Prague)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pilsner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budweiser (the original)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Buses/Metro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are essentially 30 min, 90 min and full day passes that can be bought anywhere from 1-4 euros, which is incredibly affordable for a weekend in Prague!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of hidden pieces of art within the metro. You also get access to trams, which are great to go around the city center. The metro/tram and most buses only run until midnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Walking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my opinion this city is very walkable with all the cool looking architecture and historical areas all around the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
Public transportation is recommended for far places, and then walking is nice!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know your geography in Morocco. Since everything is easily accessible by train/night train, you can plan your trip by region and not spend too long in one city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 3 main airports that you can fly into from Europe and then get around to the rest of the country either by train, or by grand taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Casablanca Airport (CMN)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is located about an hour away from the city. You can grab an uber, or a taxi. However, I would look up prices ahead of time to make sure you can bargain a good deal into the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option might be to take the train into the city, which only runs once every hour and could be sketchier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Marrakesh Menara Airport (RAK)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is located well in the city and for locals it costs only about 30 MAD by bus, or 50 MAD by taxi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are getting a taxi as a tourist, honestly try not to pay over 100 MAD because then you're just getting ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Tangier Airport (TNG)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Casablanca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Hassan II Mosque&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Quartier Tabous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main souk of Casablanca. It's not that big compared to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jemaa El Fna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main souk / medina of Marrakech! This is where all the shops are that run for endless alleys. It is open all day and all night, so it is quite an experience to see the snake charmers during the day and all the shops come out in force at night when it cools down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ignore any of the locals with monkeys chained up. They steal monkeys from their home and mistreat them for tourists to take photos with them. If you really want to see a monkey in it's natural habitat, go to Ouzoud waterfalls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ouzoud Waterfall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tremendous sight 3 hours drive away from Marrakesh. You can book excursions here through tripadvisor, or viator. I only paid about 40 euros per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are wild monkeys here, Berber locals and an amazing waterfall. There are plenty of restaurants and local shops that you can buy souvenirs from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend asking your hotel/airbnb hosts about these things, or checking out tripadvisor. Morocco is not advanced like most US/EU cities, so you have to really explore and be comfortable trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Tangine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main Moroccan food. It essentially consists of some couscous and slow cooked meat and vegetables. It's great to try at least a few times! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Bazaar Cafe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rue Sidi El Yamani 24 Bis - Marrakech
www.bazaarcafe.ma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Roti D'or&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're sick and tired of eating tangine, then come here! This is a great kebab/falafel restaurant that is super cheap within the Jema El Fana in Marrakech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the local taxi system, or Uber. You generally want to establish the price of the taxi before getting in. "Combien" is the French word for "how much".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a taxi (and you don't have the japanese app), you can always ask the restaurant/bar/store you are at to order a taxi. They are always perfectly happy to call the taxis for you using their app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Probably taxi for within a city and trains/buses/grand taxis for across the country.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Munich International Airport
Getting to the city from the airport is extremely easy. Just check google maps and you can take a direct S (1, or 8) train into the city. You can easily buy a ticket before reaching the station (within the airport) because it will definitely be crowded if it's tourist season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;0. Dachau Concentration Camp (!)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most important places to visit in Munich I think. You can google map and just take a short train ride over to this area. Then there is an easy to use bus, which you will need to use coins to buy a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Museum Brandhorst&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. St Peter's Church Tower / Marianplatz&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the central location in old town and is a lively place with lots of small shops. It features a really old and pretty looking church. It is a short walk to Hofbrauhaus and Viktualienmarkt where you can get a lot of good street food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Eisbachwelle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a local gem. This area is where surfers come for a man-made river that is just off the side of the road under a bridge. You can come here and spend some time looking at surfers go on some crazy waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Hofgarten&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty garden area close to the local government building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Friedensengel (Angel of Peace)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historic monument dedicated to peace. Made out of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. English Garden (Monopterus)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD (closed during winter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7. BMW Museum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BMW is headquartered in Munich and this museum features all the history and culture behind BMW. Very cool place to check out and also next door features all their luxury and next-generation cars on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;8. Nymphenburg Palace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An old palace that is worth walking around and checking out. The local huge pond features a bunch of swans always swimming around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10. Flaucher&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Pasta e Basta&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great pasta for a simple price&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Steinhall 16&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great place for wiener-schnitzel and also currywurst!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Viktualienmarkt&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great area for street food and local shopping for spices if you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Haufbrohaus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A touristic beer hall that features 1 Liter beers and some traditional bavarian style food. It's a great place to go listen to live music, meet new people and get really really drunk. The beer is actually quite tasty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Burrito Company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're craving Mexican food while in Europe, this is the place to go. With a student ID, you can get a really authentic cheap burrito meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Augustiner Braustuben&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a less touristic beer hall, that features the local Augustiner beer. In my opinion it is a great beer and probably the best in Munich. Less crowded and boisterous then Haufbrohaus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Oktoberfest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Christmas Markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pink Christmas Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christkindlmarkt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christmas Market at the Chinese Tower&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around would be the S line and the U, which goes throughout the entire city. It is pay by an honor system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other then that, you can take an Uber or a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="travel"></category><category term="europe"></category><category term="germany"></category><category term="munich"></category></entry><entry><title>Important Concepts for Computational Modeling</title><link href="/blog/2017/09/fundamental-computational-modeling/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-27T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2017-09-27T00:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Adam Li</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-09-27:/blog/2017/09/fundamental-computational-modeling/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;To keep a log of important concepts in computational modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;!-- MarkdownTOC --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computational modeling involves setting up mathematical equations that represent some sort of statics, or dynamics within a system. You want to simulate these equations to understand behavior, fixed points, bifurcations and changes wrt parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Concepts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Numerical Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numerical integration involves solving system of differential equations via numerical methods. This is in general split into deterministic vs stochastic differential equations. Here we will also split the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deterministic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Euler's Method&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Runge-Kutta Method(s)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stochastic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heun methods seem to be more accurate, but more time consuming vs the Milstein method.
1) Heun Method
Simple discretization leading to Stratonovich integral. It is a "predictor-corrector method" because given value of X at time &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t_n\)&lt;/span&gt;, obtain predictors with Euler integration scheme, then correct it using Heun's correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details to be filled in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Milstein Method
Uses the derivative of the diffusion coefficients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Considerations:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Convergence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Deterministic and Stochastic Differential Equations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Deterministic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example would be a population growth model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dx_t = Kx_t dt,\ x(0)=x_0\)&lt;/span&gt;, with K being some constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if we have some inherent randomness, then maybe we can't assume &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x_0\)&lt;/span&gt; is deterministic constant, but perhaps a random variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Stochastic Differential Equations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example would be a population growth model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dX_t(w) = KX_t(w) dt,\ X_0(w)\)&lt;/span&gt;, with K being some constant and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X_t(w)\)&lt;/span&gt; is a random variable, which comes from the initial condition. K could also be random.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dX_t(w) = (Kdt + dW_t(w))X_t(w) dt,\ X_0(w)\)&lt;/span&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dW_t(w)\)&lt;/span&gt; is some noise process that adds randomness to K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leads us to the general SDE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dX_t(w) = f_t(X_t(w))dt + \sigma_t(X_t(w))dW_t(w),\ X_0(w)\)&lt;/span&gt;, where f is the deterministic drift of the SDE. &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sigma_t\)&lt;/span&gt; is the diffusion coefficient, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(dW_t(w)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the noise process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can rewrite the SDE in integral form, which leads us to the Stratonovich integral and the Ito integral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(X_t(w) = X_0(w) + \int_t_0 f_s(X_s(w)) ds + \int_t_0 \sigma_s(X_s(w)) dW_s(w)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ito integral =&amp;gt;
Stratonovich integral =&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using convolutional and recurrent neural networks, this paper showed that they could perform seizure detection as well as incidence detection (of some experimental marker). I am interested in the possibility of exploring how this algorithm might perform on simulated TVB data, which to my knowledge has not been done yet. I would be interested in seeing how this improves, or is similar to training on the real data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I was going to see if I could extend this same network onto the fragility maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering:
1. Would it be possible to get access to patient's SEEG data that has the SEEG xyz coordinates, and raw iEEG data? (n as big as can be)
2. A problem with the previous paper was the unbalance of data in training (e.g. much less seizure starts, then non seizure instances). For TVB, is it possible to virtually ensure seizures happen at a certain rate if I simulated for say... 2 minutes, 100 times? So that we could have many instances of seizure occurence and could train on an equal set of seizure occurence and non seizure?
3. Can TVB determine when the seizure occurred exactly in Epileptor time series?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TVB is a platform for simulating whole-brain dynamics that starts from raw data involving:
    1. structural connectivity derived from DTI
    2. brain parcellation derived from MRI and CT
    3. SEEG xyz locations derived from MRI and CT
This will then determine a gain matrix to determine SEEG signals from the source signals that are generated from neural mass models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural mass models will be implemented with nonlinear, complex models for simulating certain type of electrophysiology. The Epileptor is used for simulating seizure activity from a specific source region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epileptor is a set of coupled differential equations that rely on 6 different variables. They are described here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data &amp;amp; Metadata&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minimum necessary requirements for creating the TVB dataset are a set of T1 and DWI images as a list of dicom files, or a single 4-D image nifti file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high level summary of how the pipeline proceeds is:
1. Construct Cortical Surface, Subcortical Surface
Using freesurfer, you can get the reconstructed surfaces, which are your files that outline the voxels that belong to each region of the brain.
2. Construct Parcellation Scheme
This can range from the default in freesurfer to different atlases available for the human brain.
3. Construct Corticography Tracts
First, you need to coregister the DWI images with the T1 scans&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the DWI images, along with the reconstructed surfaces, you can count fiber tracts between each region of the brain and reconstruct the structural connectivity matrices. This is composed from the weights matrix and the length matrix between parcellated regions.
4. Obtain Electrode Coordinates in T1 Space
First, you need to coregister the CT reconstructed freesurfer file into the T1 space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Setting Up Environment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First you may want to set up a conda environment, or a virtualenv that will separate the entire python project from your normal OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$
pip install nibabel networkx
git clone https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-data
git clone https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-library
$
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to have a script to add these all to path for your jupyter notebook, use the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="highlighttable"&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="linenos"&gt;&lt;div class="linenodiv"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1
2
3

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Launching IPython Notebook from TVB Distribution&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; -z &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LANG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;LANG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;en_US.UTF-8
&lt;span class="k"&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;LC_ALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LANG&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# add tvb data and library to path and launch notebook&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/_tvbdata:&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;pwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;/_tvblibrary:&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
jupyter notebook
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1b. Setting Up Environment on a Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. /soft/miniconda3/activate
conda env list
conda create -n tridesclous python=3.6 scipy numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn pyqt=5 ipykernel
source activate tridesclous
pip install pyqtgraph
pip install https://github.com/tridesclous/tridesclous/archive/master.zip
python -m ipykernel install --name tridesclous-testing —user
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary / Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us define X as input signal, and Y as desired output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, they were interested in deriving a quantitative method for optimizing 1) compression rate of a signal and 2) the choice of representation of the original signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous theory looked at minimizing the rate of compression given a constraint on expected distortion of the original signal (with new compression). This was solved via iterative algorithm (similar to EM), but lacked generality to find optimal representatives, which minimize the expected distortion (not just compression) of the signal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new theory looks at minimizing the rate of compression given a constraint on the amount of information we can keep about Y using X. This produces an iterative algorithm that also can be solved iteratively. It also shows that 1) the Kullback-Leibler divergence is the relevant distortion measure for the information bottleneck setting, and 2) optimization of representation of signal and the signal compression can be done together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work can be used in applications to information processing problems (e.g. deep learning).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutual information is defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(X;Y) = D_{KL}[P(x,y)||P(x)P(y)] = \sum_{x\in X, y\in Y} P(x,y) log(\frac_{P(x,y)}_{P(x)P(y)})\)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(= \sum_{x\in X, y\in Y}P(x,y) log(\frac_{P(x|y)}_{P(x)}) = H(X) - H(X|Y)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;, where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(D_{KL}(p||q)\)&lt;/span&gt; is the Kullback-Liebler divergence of distributions p and q, and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H(X)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(H(X|Y)\)&lt;/span&gt; are entropy and conditional entropies, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want the optimal representations of signal X with respect to output label Y. Sufficient statistics are maps/partitions of X, S(X) that captures all the information X has about Y. The mutual information given Y is equal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(S(X); Y) = I(X; Y)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can allow the map to be stochastic, with encoder P(T|X) and allow map to capture as much as possible of I(X;Y), not necessarily all of it &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(S(X); Y) \leq I(X; Y)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Define &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(t \in T\)&lt;/span&gt; as compressed representations of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x \in X\)&lt;/span&gt;, stochastically, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p(t|x)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The following optimization problem finds a balance between compression of X and prediction of Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math"&gt;\(min_{p(t|x),p(y|t),p(t)}\ {I(X;T) - \beta I(T;Y)}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Opening the Black Box of Deep Neural Networks Via Information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reference: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00810.pdf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary / Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the authors extend their analysis of DNN using information theory. They answered the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The SGD layer dynamics in the Information plane.
First the layers increase &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(T_i;Y)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and then later decrease &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(X; T_i)\)&lt;/span&gt;, which corresponds to increasing the information about Y and then later compressing the representation (empirical error minimization &amp;amp; representation compression phase).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The effect of the training sample size on the layers.
It seems that sample size does not have an effect on empirical error minimization, but does have an effect on the representation compression. Smaller sample sizes has overfitting, which has been seen as overfitting the sample noise. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the benefit of the hidden layers?
Adding hidden layers reduces the number of training epochs. It also seems to accelerate compression, but adding extra width does not seem to help. With layered diffusion of the SGD optimization (backpropagation), it seems that there is an exponential decrease in epochs with K hidden layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the final location of the hidden layers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the hidden layers form optimal IB representations?
It seems that the hidden layers converge to the optiaml IB representations. However, we can see that there can be clearly many different layers that correspond to the same IB representation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important hypothesis/conjecture they make is that: attempts to interpret single weights, or even single neurons in such networks can be meaningless because there is a large number of different networks that can achieve optimal performance. This makes sense in terms of how the brain is structured; the brain does not form the same pathway for learning something new between different people, but form a unique network for optimal performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Important Notes:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they estimated the mutual information of the layers with the input and with the labels &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(X;T_i)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(I(T_i;Y)\)&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need airbnb (you'll get a free $40 off):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH"&gt;https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Marseille Provence Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main airport for Marseille and it is located about 30 minutes north of the city. For transportation, you really only have two options: taxi/uber, or taking the bus. The bus is actually very convenient and runs every ~15-20 minutes and goes to Aix en Provence and also Marseille St Charles Station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are 25 y/o or younger, it only costs 6 euros, but for everyone else it is 8 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge castle/basilisque that stands at the top of a hill overlooking Marseille. You can take the bus here, but I've only ever walked. It is an amazing sight to look over the city during sunset, or at night time. However, any other time is also great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Les Calanques (Best Thing!)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hiking trail and place to go to check out a sick view. This is highly recommended because all you need to do is take a bus to Luminy and then you can walk 30 minutes to an amazing vantage point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple calanques in this area; the main ones total 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are accessible by a boat that leaves from Vieux Port, Marseille, or the port of Cassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the port of Cassis from Marseille, you have to take a train, or a bus. The train from Saint Charles will leave you about 2-3 km inland, so it is not ideal. However, there is a M8 bus that leaves from Castellane metro station that will get you directly to the port of Cassis. This bus is very infrequent and the time tables are not on Google maps. You need to google "How to get to Cassis from Marseille with M8 bus" to find the timetables that are most current. At the time that I went, I don't think the bus ran on Sundays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To access the calanques via boat is easy. You just go to Vieux Port, or in Port Miou and buy a ticket for the next ferry ride. I highly recommend doing all 9 calanques to get the full experience. The sad thing is that there is no direct ferry from Port Miou to Vieux Port, or vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Cathedral La Major&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a very pretty looking cathedral that stands next to the water. It is a beautiful place to watch the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Vieux Port&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A docking port that has a lot of tourists and boats. Nice place to walk around. Feel free to come here for trips to Les Calanques, or Chateau d'lf and Frioul Archipelago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Musee des Civilisations d'Europe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really cool looking museum. This actually lights up at night and just has a really cool architecture. It is also free on the first Sunday of every month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Parc Longchamp&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Chateau d'lf&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An island fortress and former prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Frioul Archipelago&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An island 8 km off the coast of Marseille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. House of Raviolis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to Marseille looking for French food, but you're tired of sandwiches and baguettes, look no further! As a Californian, I have to say this place is definitely above average in terms of chinese food. It's moderately priced and serves some great dumplings and egg noodles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Le Maison Geney&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Noodles Chop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the mood for some good pickme up Vietnamese food, come here! It's only open at lunchtime on weekdays, but it serves some very affordable Vietnamese sandwiches, noodles and soups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Sur Le Pouce&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marseille is pretty close to Morocco and there are many immigrants here. So this place is a great bang for your $ because they serve you huge portions! It is great to try out some traditional Moroccan tangine and some meat skewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Tapas Rojas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Tako-san&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the train/metro. If you are here for the weekend, or more, I would suggest getting the 10 ride pass. It is perfectly affordable, but if you're running late, you can easily get a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other then that, feel free to walk in most areas in the south part of the city, or just call an uber!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near Vieux Port, Joliette, or the southern part of the city.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;1. Cable Theory and Compartmental Modeling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Examples of different types of neurons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are thalamic cells, pyramidal cells, double pyramidal cells, granule cells, purkinje cells. These all have different morphologies and perform different computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximate dendrites as uniform membrane cylandiers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synaptic inputs are approximated as 'injected currents'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the cable equation to create a system of differential equations for each cylinder.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Sealed end:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;input conductance of the finite cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;s.s. voltage along cable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Concatenated Cables:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compute V(X) along branches, by determining &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(G_{out}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Definitions:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know definitions and related biology of:
- axial resistance, the resistance to current flow along the uniform cable (along the dendrite)
- membrane resistance, the resistance of current flow out of the dendrite
- membrance capacitance, the capacitance of a patch of membrane surface area
- derive cable equation as a model of concatenated RC circuits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Compartmental Models:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be able to derive system of equations into a matrix form for a linear time-invariant system &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand how transfer resistances work. Understand how distributing synaptic inputs works. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Derive AND-NOT operator (shunting inhibition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;2. Generalized Linear Models:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Form of Exponential Family Distribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be able to define all the terms, such as: natural paramters, sufficient statistic, natural link function, dispersion parameter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;3. Kalman Filter&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stochastic State-Space Model&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, list the linear, time-invariant system with a state evolution equation and measurement/observation equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;state and observation noises are independent, zero-mean Gaussian white processes with some defined covariances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;initial state x_0 is a Gaussian R.V. independent of the state/observation noises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Derivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derive the Kalman filter equations for the state update, covarariance estimates&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Relation to a Least-Squares Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Relation to a Bayesian Maximum Aposteri Estimation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;4. Expectation Maximization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic Idea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By computing the likelihood of your unknown parameters, based on known outcomes. You can perform maximum likelihood estimation to get the best estimate of the unknown parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;5. K-Means Algorithm&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cost Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost function is attempting to minimize the distortion (distance to centers) for every point in the set of data points, S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'''
Input: k clusters
initialize centers: z_1, ..., z_k \in \real^d and clusters C_1, ..., C_k
repeat until there is no further change in L(z, C):
    for each j (data point): C_j &amp;lt;- {x \in S whose closest center is z_j}
    for each j (data point): z_j &amp;lt;- mean(C_j) 
'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk through for a small example to see how the algorithm works:
(0, 0, 0)
(0, 0.5, 1)
(1, 3, 2)

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? 
A: Generally, I'm an advocate of staying downtown because then everything is walking distance. If not, I would try to stay within walking distance to a subway station. Stay away from South Chicago because that is a very crime-ridden area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Seoul, where should I go?
A: Purple pig, Girl on the goat, Lou Malnati's to eat. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park and the River Walk to see. Signature Room for a night time drink if you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need airbnb (you'll get a free $40 off):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH"&gt;https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/lffud"&gt;https://www.uber.com/invite/lffud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need lyft (you'll get a free ride!):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866"&gt;https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Peabody Library:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main library of the peabody institute (music school and concert hall). It's very beautiful and free to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Inner Harbor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the harbor of Baltimore and where a lot of ships are docked. Around here you can check out various ships for a small entrance fee of ~$10-20. It also has a lot of shops around the area, a Shake Shack, a huge Barnes &amp;amp; Noble (which was built inside a battery factory) and a lot of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. National Aquarium:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the NATIONAL aquarium and costs about $40 normally to get into. However, if you come at night time starting at around 4PM, you can get in for half price. It's worth checking out because it's very big and national for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Fort Mchenry:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fort where the Star Spangled Banner was born. It has a lot of American history and costs about $10 to go through. You can reach this location by car, or you can even take a water ferry from the Inner Harbor for a nice ride in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Miss Shirley's Cafe:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very famous and exquisite breakfast/brunch cafe in the general Virginia/Maryland area. They have amazing drinks (I highly suggest going for a boozy brunch) and also amazing fried chicken &amp;amp; waffles. Also, you should try the french toast, fried green tomatoes and monkey bread. A must if you visit Baltimore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Woodberry Kitchen:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the best restaurants in Baltimore. It is slightly on the more expensive side, but it is still affordable for a one time meal. Everything is incredibly rustic and feels like it came out of a cabin home kitchen. The atmosphere is very homey and can be a good meal for a couple, or even a medium sized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chocolate Over Water:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small restaurant great for brunch, lunch or even dinner! It is BYOB, so you can even bring your own wine bottle. The menu is great and I would follow Yelp. You can't really go wrong with portion size and dollars spent here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Abbey's Burger House:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're into crazy exotic burgers, this is the place to be. They have meat ranging from deer, to ox, to regular beef. Burgers are pretty good and it's nice to have a beer while watching sports. Go Lakers/Warriors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. LP Steamers:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland is known for their crab and this is definitely the place to get it! This is a multiple story restaurant, where you will definitely need to wait an hour or two to get in (if you have a large group). You can order crabs and crack them open with your own wooden hammer. It is definitely a must-try experience for all Maryland first-timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Fell's Point:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bars ranging from the Horse You Came In On, to Bond Street. Honestly, if you're into dive bars, come check it out. If you're into partying/clubbing, not the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Federal Hill (Fed Hill):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many bars, so you can easily bar hop! Beware, there are a lot of college (wannabe frat stars) kids here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Mt. Vernon / Charles Village:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More classy and upscale bars. I would recommend checking out WC Harlan, which is a speakeasy located in south part of Charles Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber/Lyft are incredibly cheap within this city. I would use this solely because the subway system is not that great and the bus system isn't ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the circulators are generally free if you are just looking to get a free ride from Hopkins -&amp;gt; Inner Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? 
A: I would try to stay at Inner Harbor, Fed Hill, or Canton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Baltimore, where should I go?
A: Miss Shirley's, Woodberry Kitchen, and Chocolate Over Water to eat. Inner Harbor and the National Aquarium to see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to be added:
1. sample itinerary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've added to different sights, whether it is good for indoors (when weather is poor)! Look for the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\bold{[X]}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH"&gt;https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D"&gt;https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need lyft (you'll get a free ride!):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866"&gt;https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to/from the airport, you can take the metro, which is only about $3. Else, you can take uber/lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Hare Airport: &lt;br /&gt;
This is the main airport that is a lot larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway Airport: &lt;br /&gt;
This is the main airport that services Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the home of the infamous Chicago Bean. The entire area has very cool architecture, and there is a snake bridge that goes over the highway that leads to a park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend coming to check out the Bean once during the day and once in the late afternoon. The different lights provide for a truly appreciative experience. If you're into checking out cool parks, go to the playground that is across the snake bridge. There's an incredible playground built for kids, but it's a great experience to relive your childhood making your way through the slides, tree houses and swings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Art Institute of Chicago: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would highly recommend if you're into art. A great collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chicago Architecture River Tour: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is advertised all over the city. A ticket costs ~$35 and you go on a large boat that will take you on a guided tour throughout the river and talk about some of the history of Chicago and its beautiful architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the price seems hefty, it's a great thing to try at least once (hell, I've gone twice and loved it both times). I would definitely recommend trying this in the warmer seasons because it can get unbearably cold outside on the boat deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Willis Tower / Sears Tower:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was at one point the tallest building in the USA and houses the infamous glass cube. You've probably seen a bunch of your friends Instagram this. If you're afraid of heights, it might not be the best idea. However, it definitely makes for a cool sight and is worth the trip at least once. 
It does cost quite a bit of money to go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Lincoln Park Zoo: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is free, so why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Crown Fountain: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to Cloud Gate, you just have to venture a bit south to reach this beautiful sight. It's essentially a huge fountain that is great to take photos of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Navy Pier: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pier that you can walk around, which houses a ferris wheel and a bunch of other amusement park rides. It's a great walk during the warmer seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. River Walk: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incredible area is essentially a walkway along the river of Chicago. It takes you from the Trump Tower all the way down the river, and is an incredible place to walk during the daytime as well as night time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note, that there is a closing time for the river walk at night (~11PM), so I would go around 9 if you want to grab some great night shots of Chicago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Deep Dish Pizza: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has heard about the infamous Chicago deep dish pizza. Well if you're into pizza, meat, cheese and sauce, then it's really worth the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The places that are well worth the try are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lou Malnati's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giordano's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pizzeria Uno &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to decide which one is the best, but for my personal preference I like them in this order because Lou generally has a better crust. It's more crunchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Garrett's Popcorn: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a famous popcorn place that sells all different kinds of popcorn. You name it; they probably have it. Everything from caramel, chocolate covered, to regular popcorn, Garrett's has it all. This is great for souvenirs for friends/family/coworkers because they sell them either in traditional popcorn bags, or in to-go containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Purple Pig: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in all of USA. It's a tapas place (family style sharing of small plates), so definitely try to come with a group. There is generally a wait, so I would recommend putting your name down early around dinner opening, or lunch opening, and then possibly going and walking along the RiverWalk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on what to eat because truly everything there is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Girl on the Goat: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also by far one of my most favorite restaurants in all of USA. It's a tapas place (family style sharing of small plates), so definitely try to come with a group. It's slightly more upscale and more expensive then the Purple Pig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would advise MAKING A RESERVATION well before your trip. If you have a large group, there is no way you will get seated if you are only in town for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on what to eat because truly everything there is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Wildberry Cafe: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite brunch place. It's right next to Cloud Gate / Millenium Park. Hands down, make sure you try their specialty pancakes and pretty much everything else on the menu is great. There will always be a wait, so you can put your name down and then go check out Millenium Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. The Mid: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a night club that houses some DJs from time to time (e.g. I saw Dash Berlin here once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Sound Bar: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a night club that houses some DJs from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Three Dots and a Dash: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a speakeasy that has very instagram/snapchat worthy drinks. It's worth checking out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Signature Room: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not willing to pay to go up to Willis Tower, you can come here to grab a drink and get a free view of Chicago. It's great to see both during the day and at night because of Chicago's night lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. JPark Rooftop Bar: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rooftop bar that is just a great place to chill and relax. You can place reservations if you have a large group, so make sure to do that, else it can get crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Goose Island Brewery: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard it's good. I'll have to check it out and leave my comments here sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the advent of Uber/Lyft, you could definitely get around by just walking and taking the subway. There is a 'blue line' that is open 24/7, which is AMAZING. Chicago sells 3 day all-you-can-ride tickets for $20, but to be honest with Uber/Lyft, you can easily get around and save a lot more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to/from the airports, you can easily take the subway lines to wherever you're staying. I would recommend this over Uber/Lyft because it's only a few dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you're downtown, generally you can walk everywhere. So I would advise just using the subway to/from the airport and then Uber/Lyft with your group elsewhere. Obviously if you're solo traveling, I would probably get a multi-day subway pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? &lt;br/&gt;
A: Generally, I'm an advocate of staying downtown because then everything is walking distance. If not, I would try to stay within walking distance to a subway station. Stay away from South Chicago because that is a very crime-ridden area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Chicago, where should I go? &lt;br/&gt;
A: Purple pig, Girl on the goat, Lou Malnati's to eat. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park and the River Walk to see. Signature Room for a night time drink if you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;References:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- /MarkdownTOC --&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After getting your virtualenv setup, run 'pip install pelican'. Also include additional packages:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'pip install Markdown beautifulsoup4 typogrify Pillow webassets'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for helping to write in Markdown and writing pretty text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start up pelican&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pelican-quickstart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then go through the directions and create your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Choosing Your Hosting Server&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of options, but you should decide how you want to host your site because then it will be built into your pelican project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Github Pages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S3 by Amazon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heroku, PythonAnywhere, and More&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installing and Choosing Themes/Plugins&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to install the pelican themes and the pelican plugins, if you want to use the open source themes and plugins developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to these two websites to get your themes/plugins.
https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes
https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, you can follow those instructions to get a certain theme setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes.git
git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;PLUGIN_PATHS = [&amp;#39;path/to/pelican-plugins&amp;#39;]
PLUGINS = [&amp;#39;assets&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;sitemap&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;gravatar&amp;#39;]

JINJA_ENVIRONMENT = {&amp;#39;extensions&amp;#39;: [&amp;#39;jinja2.ext.i18n&amp;#39;]}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Pushing Content to Cloud&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'pip install ghp-import fabric'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using ghp-import:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First run install by 'pip install ghp-import'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can run code like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ghp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;commit message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;master&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;--&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;all&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using fab:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First install fabric by running 'pip install fabric'. Then insert code into your fabfile.py:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;publishghp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;preview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#builds publishconf.py&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;git add -A&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;#will commit allll files, be careful&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;git commit -m &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ghp-import -m &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;#39; -b master output&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;git push --all&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;and then run &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ fab publishghp:&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;commit message&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;to create commits up to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Adding Pages of Static Content&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here you want to add a homepage, about me page and other static pages that are relevant to your site. Create a directory inside /content/pages/ to hold your static pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Adding Articles To Your Blog&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To add articles to your blog, create /content/blog/ directory and create subdirectories in there. For example, I have academic, coding, and travel as my subdirectories in my blog. Then adjust your pelicanconf.py file for these blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Adding Gallery / Images To Your Blog&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VirtualEnv: 15.1.0
VirtualEnvWrapper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A virtual environment is useful for development in Python because it keeps your packages for certain projects separate from each other. It'll keep everything for that project separated in a separate wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Installing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For virtualenvironment, follow https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For virtualenvwrapper, follow http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Basics (Create, Delete):&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Create&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenvwrapper: Run the command &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;mkvirtualenv &amp;lt;envname&amp;gt;&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenv: Run command &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;virtualenv &amp;#39;./venv/&amp;#39;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;inside your project directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also run 'mkvirtualenv -p python3', or 'virtualenv -p python3' to make the virtual environment with a specific python installation (e.g. 2.7, or 3.4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Delete a Virtualenv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenvwrappper: In order to delete a virtual environment, all you need to do is to remove it recursively from your ~/.virtualenvs directory with    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#39;sudo rm -rf &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;&amp;#39;.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For Virtualenv: Go to the directory of your project and delete the /venv/ directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tips&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Starting up your Venv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startup your virtual environment by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;workon name_of_virtualenvironment
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;2. Working on TVB with Venv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Requirements.txt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a convenient file for you to make that keeps track of all your packages. If you ever want to run your project on a new computer, you just create a new virtual environment and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install -r requirements.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To create the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip freeze &amp;gt; requirements.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Convenient Tools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Automatically cd To Project Directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Input the following code to your ./virtualenvs/postactivate file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    # subtract strings to get the project name
    function get_project_name() {
        local venv_dir=&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_HOOK_DIR&lt;/span&gt;
        local venv=&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$VIRTUAL_ENV&lt;/span&gt;

        temp_project_name=&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;venv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#&amp;quot;$venv_dir&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;   # get difference between two strings
        project_name=&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;temp_project_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;     # remove leading &amp;#39;/&amp;#39; character

        echo &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$project_name&lt;/span&gt;
        ## uncomment for debugging
        # echo &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$venv_dir&lt;/span&gt;
        # echo &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$venv&lt;/span&gt;
        # echo &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$temp_project_name&lt;/span&gt;
        # echo &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$project_name&lt;/span&gt;
    }

    # export proj=&amp;quot;cd ~/Documents/$(get_project_name)&amp;quot;
    root_dir=&amp;#39;/Users/adam2392/Documents/&amp;#39;
    project_dir=$(get_project_name)
    cd &lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;root_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="cp"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;project_dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Make sure you change 'root_dir' to the correct root directory of your projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This assumes that your project directory files are all correspondingly named with your virtualenv. This is convenient for changing directory into your project directory automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

I took some time around 1 year ago to plan out ten things I wanted to carry out in 2016. I've enjoyed it a lot because it's been a goal to work towards for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I want to look at what I set out to do, and where I've come in regards to those goals. It will be interesting to see how my own priorities simply a year ago changed throughout the year and what I want to keep and discard for 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Old 2016 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Definitely did it with Vegas trips, Coachella, Asia traveling, San Francisco, Chicago and New York City. All were done with great friends that I would take a bullet for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Read more about politics and current events in our country. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I think this year was a turmoil in the United States with Donald Trump having been elected. Personally, I was spurred to follow and read more news through Twitter, Facebook and news journal sites. Although I have yet to become an expert, it has definitely exposed me to thought leaders ranging from Democratic/Republican leaders to news journalists to high ranking company executives. I've begun formulating my own thoughts on the topic (which I won't go into) and I think it's really helped me think about what I want for my future, my family's future, my children's future and my country's future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Start choreographing again. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Totally did not do this. Will have to put this on a higher priority list this year!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Enter in 1-2 jams. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hurt my ankle during the time frame when I could've definitely entered the jam at Johns Hopkins. I'm pretty disappointed though that I didn't try to do more while it was summer time and I was still relatively free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I definitely had a late start this year by only doing this towards the end of 2016, but I'm definitely getting more into it. I've learned the basics of manipulating aperture, shutter speed and angles. It's really fun and I'm surprised by how excited I get over good photos and photo opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM. [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think logging experiences in graduate school are important, but more important are reaching those milestones. I've realized how tough different aspects of the PhD are and I think for 2017 I would want to focus more effort on tangibly meeting milestones in graduate school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp;amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Got lazy and then my ankle got hurt, but I definitely want to try again for 2017!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Spend less time on myself and volunteer more. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- I don't think I've done this at all, but in a different interpretation I've focused more on making an impact outside of research. I'm very excited to say that I started HEME (Hopkins Engineering Medicine Exchange) with one of my close friends in graduate school and I have big dreams for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;9. Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat). [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't do a great job towards the beginning because I think as all millennials are, I was addicted to seeing how other people's lives were progressing. However, simply today, one of my good friends showed me a video I think is worth sharing. (https://www.facebook.com/deltaprotective/videos/10157890106040640/?hc_ref=NEWSFEED) I want to spend even less time by keeping "Kill News Feed" and using Instagram/Facebook simply to log photographs I take and memories I want to engrave.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Be content with paying my dues. [x]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this year I started to examine what excites me in life and what excites me about the future. It definitely isn't working at some corporate 9-5 job (even if I think the job is "impactful"). It's innovating and pushing the bounds of medicine using engineering, mathematics and computer programming. These topics are what excite me, while medicine is what spurs me to make a difference. I'm looking forward to spending ~5 (hopefully) years at Johns Hopkins absorbing different learning experiences and getting my Masters in Applied Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics while I'm also there. Why not get a free additional education with the PhD while I'm there?
6/10 kinda. I guess not bad :p.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;New 2017 Resolutions:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Keep dance a significant part of my life: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I might not be able to choreograph a piece, participate in jams and get involved in dance photography, I want to simply keep bboying, keep taking choreo classes and keep my camera/gopro at all major dance events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Run a half-marathon: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to start running couple miles at the gym every other day and hopefully do one in the spring :).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Read four new books: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year, I've managed to read ~4 books due to a book club established with my friends and I. It's made me more engaged in my own self development because I spent less time on social media and video games before sleeping. I want to do it again with or without another book club.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Establish a healthy workout regimen: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Been exercising at the gym more this year and I'm pretty happy with where I've gotten. I think being able to deadlift 245 and bench 225 are solid goals to have for this year. While continuing dancing, I hope to live a healthier lifestyle. In addition, this could entail just eating healthier through (salad every other day and cooking most nights that I have time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Put myself in uncomfortable situations: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think this last one encompasses a number of things I think I need to go through. Although my friend circles aren't the same in Baltimore as in California, there are people I meet everyday that offer unique perspectives. Engaging in making relations is the first one. I haven't really explored doing "activities" for fun, such as hiking and exploring. I want to put myself out there and go on more "naturey" activites. I've had a lot of fun doing that in the past couple of months and I think it will only improve when I go into 2017.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Begin to learn French: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using duolingo and trying to put myself out there with possibly a solo adventure to Europe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Keep learning more "unrelated" math: [ ]&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my research I have a very focused area that I am developing, but I want to become a thought leader in data science one day. The only way to do that is to continue my reading of papers unrelated to my research and continue my textbook reading of different topics, such as matrix theory and bayesian statistics. The more I understand, the more I might even be able to apply to my PhD research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Build 3 Node, JS, React webapps this year&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping it under 10 this year because I recently read about Warren Buffet's 5/25 rule and am inspired by its logic. Happy 2017 everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="personal"></category><category term="goals"></category></entry><entry><title>Personal Goals - 2016</title><link href="/blog/2015/12/goals-2016/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Li</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-12-31:/blog/2015/12/goals-2016/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A summary of goals for 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Each year passes by faster and faster in my opinion, so I want to make the most out of 2016. As 2016 comes and 2015 comes to a close, I want to make some resolutions and goals for the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend more effort and time on good friends and ignore the rest.
- This year I realized that even someone who you've known for years can exit your life in an instant. I want to spend more time and money on people that are there for you when you're up and down. When shit went down for me, people who I thought I could count on were nowhere to be seen. Why waste time and effort on those people?
Read more about politics and current events in our country.
- I think that coming from California is a blessing in many ways. However, I think that we take for granted all the things we have. There is a lot of different things happening around the country (e.g. politics) that I did not educate myself on. Using politico and pulse apps to keep up to date
Start choreographing again.
- Throughout undergrad, I made excuses for not trying more in dance to improve. Whether it was coursework, social life, or laziness, I didn't put in time and effort into my passion. Will try to do at least 1 piece and work on it throughout the year.
Enter in 1-2 jams.
- Been bboying for almost 8 years and it has carried me through undergrad and high school. Want to continue going for top 8 in some big jams until I can't bboy anymore.
Begin taking photos and videos more during the year and documenting them.
- My dad gave me his old Nikon D5000 and I got a GoPro at the beginning of the summer. Photography is a way for me to keep involved in the hip hop scene once I can't dance anymore. Videos and photos are also great of documenting the year!
Continue blogging about graduate school and the milestones of a PhD in STEM.
- There are a lot of challenges and obstacles to overcome to get to a PhD program. There are also many to overcome whilst in the program. I want to talk about various events including: preparing for grad school in undergrad, applying for grad school, applying for fellowships, picking your rotations, picking your coursework, picking your advisor, choosing a thesis committee, structuring and studying for your DBO and then research on a daily basis. My goal is to graduate from this PhD as soon as possible (ideally 4-5 years) and start working to get industry experience.
Run a half-marathon: Rock &amp;amp; Roll Half Marathon in SD/DC
- Been saying that I wanna do this for years... time to get started.
Spend less time on myself and volunteer more.
- Spent too much time saying I wanna help out and not enough time doing. Getting involved in THREAD at Baltimore is one step and I hope to do more. The world is too big to just always be working on yourself.
Spend less time on social media (Facebook and Snapchat).
- Good for seeing friends and chatting. Good for sending some updates once in awhile and documenting photos/videos. Not good for productivity. Aim: go from online once/day to once/two days this year.
Be content with paying my dues.
- I've always been anxious to accomplish things. However, over the next 4 years, I realized it'll be grind and work. Gaining the technical skills so I can set myself up for maximizing the probability of succeeding in a technical startup. Just have to be patient and have this same dream when I'm 29.
All resolutions are goals in my opinion. The only real way to accomplish a goal that you set your mind to is work on them in minimal increments. In entrepreneurship, they call these minimal viable products (MVPs). Everyone should check back on these goals at least once/month over 2016 to see how they're doing and work on them like they're MVPs. Won't that make for an even more exciting 2017? Happy new years. It's going to be a good one.
