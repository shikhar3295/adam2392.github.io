&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Lyon Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Basilisque Notre Dame Foire:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially another basilisque that is very beautiful and overlooks Lyon. It has an amazing view of the city. If you want nice lighting, I suggest coming in the middle to late afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is located on Fourviere Hill. Note that Google maps shows a circular route to take up the hill, but there is a staircase at the bottom that goes straight up. You just have to find it :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Vieux Lyon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historic area of the city that is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Le Mur Des Canuts:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a huge mural on the side of a building in the northern part of Lyon. It is incredibly picturesque and it's very fun to just try different poses to fit into the mural!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Musée Des Beaux-arts de Lyon:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest fine art museum after the Louvre in Paris. It is only 4 euros for a student, so it is highly recommended to go and check out some great art! There are some Monet pieces in here that are absolutely amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Parc de La Tete d’Or:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a super cool looking park, known as the Golden Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Slake:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic coffee cafe that serves some great breakfast foods, like quiche, sandwiches and cookies. Highly recommend as a start off to your day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Yaafa:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is essentially a vegetarian falafel shop that is extremely affordable and absolutely delicious. I highly recommend coming here if you're just sick and tired of French food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Bollywood Tandoor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an authentic Indian restaurant that also serves a buffet style portion. It's not bad and pretty affordable too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Lyonnaise Cuisine:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're going to be in Lyon, then you absolutely have to try Lyonnaise cuisine once. Go on Tripadvisor and make a reservation for a heavily reviewed restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Wine Drinking On the Rhone:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around the Rhone, there are walkways and bleacher type seats that you can just sit on and drink wine with your group. It is actually really beautiful, relaxing and affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pretty much walk this entire city, but if you're feeling tired, Uber is plentiful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near the rivers Rhone and Saone towards the center of the city, else you'll spend an incredible amount of time walking/ubering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Know your geography in Morocco. Since everything is easily accessible by train/night train, you can plan your trip by region and not spend too long in one city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are about 3 main airports that you can fly into from Europe and then get around to the rest of the country either by train, or by grand taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Casablanca Airport (CMN)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is located about an hour away from the city. You can grab an uber, or a taxi. However, I would look up prices ahead of time to make sure you can bargain a good deal into the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option might be to take the train into the city, which only runs once every hour and could be sketchier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Marrakesh Menara Airport (RAK)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This airport is located well in the city and for locals it costs only about 30 MAD by bus, or 50 MAD by taxi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are getting a taxi as a tourist, honestly try not to pay over 100 MAD because then you're just getting ripped off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Tangier Airport (TNG)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Casablanca&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Hassan II Mosque&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Quartier Tabous&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main souk of Casablanca. It's not that big compared to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Marrakesh&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Jemaa El Fna&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main souk / medina of Marrakech! This is where all the shops are that run for endless alleys. It is open all day and all night, so it is quite an experience to see the snake charmers during the day and all the shops come out in force at night when it cools down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ignore any of the locals with monkeys chained up. They steal monkeys from their home and mistreat them for tourists to take photos with them. If you really want to see a monkey in it's natural habitat, go to Ouzoud waterfalls!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Ouzoud Waterfall&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tremendous sight 3 hours drive away from Marrakesh. You can book excursions here through tripadvisor, or viator. I only paid about 40 euros per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are wild monkeys here, Berber locals and an amazing waterfall. There are plenty of restaurants and local shops that you can buy souvenirs from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend asking your hotel/airbnb hosts about these things, or checking out tripadvisor. Morocco is not advanced like most US/EU cities, so you have to really explore and be comfortable trying new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Tangine&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main Moroccan food. It essentially consists of some couscous and slow cooked meat and vegetables. It's great to try at least a few times! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Bazaar Cafe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rue Sidi El Yamani 24 Bis - Marrakech
www.bazaarcafe.ma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Roti D'or&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're sick and tired of eating tangine, then come here! This is a great kebab/falafel restaurant that is super cheap within the Jema El Fana in Marrakech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TBD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the local taxi system, or Uber. You generally want to establish the price of the taxi before getting in. "Combien" is the French word for "how much".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a taxi (and you don't have the japanese app), you can always ask the restaurant/bar/store you are at to order a taxi. They are always perfectly happy to call the taxis for you using their app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Probably taxi for within a city and trains/buses/grand taxis for across the country.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Marseille Provence Airport&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main airport for Marseille and it is located about 30 minutes north of the city. For transportation, you really only have two options: taxi/uber, or taking the bus. The bus is actually very convenient and runs every ~15-20 minutes and goes to Aix en Provence and also Marseille St Charles Station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are 25 y/o or younger, it only costs 6 euros, but for everyone else it is 8 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge castle/basilisque that stands at the top of a hill overlooking Marseille. You can take the bus here, but I've only ever walked. It is an amazing sight to look over the city during sunset, or at night time. However, any other time is also great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Les Calanques&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hiking trail and place to go to check out a sick view. This is highly recommended because all you need to do is take a bus to Luminy and then you can walk 30 minutes to an amazing vantage point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Cathedral La Major&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a very pretty looking cathedral that stands next to the water. It is a beautiful place to watch the sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Vieux Port&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A docking port that has a lot of tourists and boats. Nice place to walk around. Feel free to come here for trips to Les Calanques, or Chateau d'lf and Frioul Archipelago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Musee des Civilisations d'Europe&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A really cool looking museum. This actually lights up at night and just has a really cool architecture. It is also free on the first Sunday of every month!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Parc Longchamp&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool park&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Chateau d'lf&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An island fortress and former prison &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. Frioul Archipelago&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An island 8 km off the coast of Marseille.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. House of Raviolis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you came to Marseille looking for French food, but you're tired of sandwiches and baguettes, look no further! As a Californian, I have to say this place is definitely above average in terms of chinese food. It's moderately priced and serves some great dumplings and egg noodles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Le Maison Geney&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Noodles Chop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're in the mood for some good pickme up Vietnamese food, come here! It's only open at lunchtime on weekdays, but it serves some very affordable Vietnamese sandwiches, noodles and soups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Sur Le Pouce&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marseille is pretty close to Morocco and there are many immigrants here. So this place is a great bang for your $ because they serve you huge portions! It is great to try out some traditional Moroccan tangine and some meat skewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Tapas Rojas&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Tako-san&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to get around each city would definitely be using the train/metro. If you are here for the weekend, or more, I would suggest getting the 10 ride pass. It is perfectly affordable, but if you're running late, you can easily get a taxi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other then that, feel free to walk in most areas in the south part of the city, or just call an uber!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: How do I get around?
A: Use uber, or the metro line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Q: Where should I stay?
A: I would stay near Vieux Port, Joliette, or the southern part of the city.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866"&gt;https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Peabody Library:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main library of the peabody institute (music school and concert hall). It's very beautiful and free to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Inner Harbor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the harbor of Baltimore and where a lot of ships are docked. Around here you can check out various ships for a small entrance fee of ~$10-20. It also has a lot of shops around the area, a Shake Shack, a huge Barnes &amp;amp; Noble (which was built inside a battery factory) and a lot of tourists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. National Aquarium:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the NATIONAL aquarium and costs about $40 normally to get into. However, if you come at night time starting at around 4PM, you can get in for half price. It's worth checking out because it's very big and national for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Fort Mchenry:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the fort where the Star Spangled Banner was born. It has a lot of American history and costs about $10 to go through. You can reach this location by car, or you can even take a water ferry from the Inner Harbor for a nice ride in the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Miss Shirley's Cafe:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very famous and exquisite breakfast/brunch cafe in the general Virginia/Maryland area. They have amazing drinks (I highly suggest going for a boozy brunch) and also amazing fried chicken &amp;amp; waffles. Also, you should try the french toast, fried green tomatoes and monkey bread. A must if you visit Baltimore!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Woodberry Kitchen:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably one of the best restaurants in Baltimore. It is slightly on the more expensive side, but it is still affordable for a one time meal. Everything is incredibly rustic and feels like it came out of a cabin home kitchen. The atmosphere is very homey and can be a good meal for a couple, or even a medium sized group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chocolate Over Water:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a small restaurant great for brunch, lunch or even dinner! It is BYOB, so you can even bring your own wine bottle. The menu is great and I would follow Yelp. You can't really go wrong with portion size and dollars spent here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Abbey's Burger House:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're into crazy exotic burgers, this is the place to be. They have meat ranging from deer, to ox, to regular beef. Burgers are pretty good and it's nice to have a beer while watching sports. Go Lakers/Warriors!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. LP Steamers:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maryland is known for their crab and this is definitely the place to get it! This is a multiple story restaurant, where you will definitely need to wait an hour or two to get in (if you have a large group). You can order crabs and crack them open with your own wooden hammer. It is definitely a must-try experience for all Maryland first-timers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Fell's Point:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bars ranging from the Horse You Came In On, to Bond Street. Honestly, if you're into dive bars, come check it out. If you're into partying/clubbing, not the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Federal Hill (Fed Hill):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many bars, so you can easily bar hop! Beware, there are a lot of college (wannabe frat stars) kids here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Mt. Vernon / Charles Village:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More classy and upscale bars. I would recommend checking out WC Harlan, which is a speakeasy located in south part of Charles Village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uber/Lyft are incredibly cheap within this city. I would use this solely because the subway system is not that great and the bus system isn't ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the circulators are generally free if you are just looking to get a free ride from Hopkins -&amp;gt; Inner Harbor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? 
A: I would try to stay at Inner Harbor, Fed Hill, or Canton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Baltimore, where should I go?
A: Miss Shirley's, Woodberry Kitchen, and Chocolate Over Water to eat. Inner Harbor and the National Aquarium to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;General Suggestions&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things to be added:
1. sample itinerary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've added to different sights, whether it is good for indoors (when weather is poor)! Look for the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\bold{[X]}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Important Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need airbnb (you'll get a free $40 off):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH"&gt;https://abnb.me/e/jRvXPz3dUH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need uber (you'll get a free ride!):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uber.com/invite/lffud"&gt;https://www.uber.com/invite/lffud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need taxify (you'll get a free $5 off!):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D"&gt;https://invite.taxify.eu/EZN7D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you need lyft (you'll get a free ride!):&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866"&gt;https://lyft.com/ici/ADAM10866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Airports&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to/from the airport, you can take the metro, which is only about $3. Else, you can take uber/lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O'Hare Airport: &lt;br /&gt;
This is the main airport that is a lot larger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midway Airport: &lt;br /&gt;
This is the main airport that services Southwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the home of the infamous Chicago Bean. The entire area has very cool architecture, and there is a snake bridge that goes over the highway that leads to a park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would highly recommend coming to check out the Bean once during the day and once in the late afternoon. The different lights provide for a truly appreciative experience. If you're into checking out cool parks, go to the playground that is across the snake bridge. There's an incredible playground built for kids, but it's a great experience to relive your childhood making your way through the slides, tree houses and swings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Art Institute of Chicago: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would highly recommend if you're into art. A great collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Chicago Architecture River Tour: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is advertised all over the city. A ticket costs ~$35 and you go on a large boat that will take you on a guided tour throughout the river and talk about some of the history of Chicago and its beautiful architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the price seems hefty, it's a great thing to try at least once (hell, I've gone twice and loved it both times). I would definitely recommend trying this in the warmer seasons because it can get unbearably cold outside on the boat deck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Willis Tower / Sears Tower:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was at one point the tallest building in the USA and houses the infamous glass cube. You've probably seen a bunch of your friends Instagram this. If you're afraid of heights, it might not be the best idea. However, it definitely makes for a cool sight and is worth the trip at least once. 
It does cost quite a bit of money to go up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Lincoln Park Zoo: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently this is free, so why not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Crown Fountain: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you go to Cloud Gate, you just have to venture a bit south to reach this beautiful sight. It's essentially a huge fountain that is great to take photos of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;7. Navy Pier: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pier that you can walk around, which houses a ferris wheel and a bunch of other amusement park rides. It's a great walk during the warmer seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;8. River Walk: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This incredible area is essentially a walkway along the river of Chicago. It takes you from the Trump Tower all the way down the river, and is an incredible place to walk during the daytime as well as night time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note, that there is a closing time for the river walk at night (~11PM), so I would go around 9 if you want to grab some great night shots of Chicago!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I briefly describe a couple of food places that are worth the HYPE. For locations, just use google, or yelp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. Deep Dish Pizza: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone has heard about the infamous Chicago deep dish pizza. Well if you're into pizza, meat, cheese and sauce, then it's really worth the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The places that are well worth the try are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lou Malnati's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giordano's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pizzeria Uno &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to decide which one is the best, but for my personal preference I like them in this order because Lou generally has a better crust. It's more crunchy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Garrett's Popcorn: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a famous popcorn place that sells all different kinds of popcorn. You name it; they probably have it. Everything from caramel, chocolate covered, to regular popcorn, Garrett's has it all. This is great for souvenirs for friends/family/coworkers because they sell them either in traditional popcorn bags, or in to-go containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Purple Pig: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in all of USA. It's a tapas place (family style sharing of small plates), so definitely try to come with a group. There is generally a wait, so I would recommend putting your name down early around dinner opening, or lunch opening, and then possibly going and walking along the RiverWalk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on what to eat because truly everything there is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Girl on the Goat: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also by far one of my most favorite restaurants in all of USA. It's a tapas place (family style sharing of small plates), so definitely try to come with a group. It's slightly more upscale and more expensive then the Purple Pig. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would advise MAKING A RESERVATION well before your trip. If you have a large group, there is no way you will get seated if you are only in town for a few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on what to eat because truly everything there is worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. Wildberry Cafe: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my favorite brunch place. It's right next to Cloud Gate / Millenium Park. Hands down, make sure you try their specialty pancakes and pretty much everything else on the menu is great. There will always be a wait, so you can put your name down and then go check out Millenium Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll leave it to Yelp to advise you on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Nightlife/Drinking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;1. The Mid: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a night club that houses some DJs from time to time (e.g. I saw Dash Berlin here once).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;2. Sound Bar: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a night club that houses some DJs from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;3. Three Dots and a Dash: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a speakeasy that has very instagram/snapchat worthy drinks. It's worth checking out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;4. Signature Room: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're not willing to pay to go up to Willis Tower, you can come here to grab a drink and get a free view of Chicago. It's great to see both during the day and at night because of Chicago's night lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;5. JPark Rooftop Bar: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a rooftop bar that is just a great place to chill and relax. You can place reservations if you have a large group, so make sure to do that, else it can get crowded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;6. Goose Island Brewery: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heard it's good. I'll have to check it out and leave my comments here sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the advent of Uber/Lyft, you could definitely get around by just walking and taking the subway. There is a 'blue line' that is open 24/7, which is AMAZING. Chicago sells 3 day all-you-can-ride tickets for $20, but to be honest with Uber/Lyft, you can easily get around and save a lot more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming to/from the airports, you can easily take the subway lines to wherever you're staying. I would recommend this over Uber/Lyft because it's only a few dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you're downtown, generally you can walk everywhere. So I would advise just using the subway to/from the airport and then Uber/Lyft with your group elsewhere. Obviously if you're solo traveling, I would probably get a multi-day subway pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Where should I stay? &lt;br/&gt;
A: Generally, I'm an advocate of staying downtown because then everything is walking distance. If not, I would try to stay within walking distance to a subway station. Stay away from South Chicago because that is a very crime-ridden area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: I only have a day in Chicago, where should I go? &lt;br/&gt;
A: Purple pig, Girl on the goat, Lou Malnati's to eat. Cloud Gate / Millenium Park and the River Walk to see. Signature Room for a night time drink if you have the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
